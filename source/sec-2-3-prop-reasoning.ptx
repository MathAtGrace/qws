  <objectives>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the magnitude of real numbers represented in many forms 
        (fractions, decimals, scientific notation, square roots of numbers) by ordering and comparing 
        them in mathematical and real-world contexts. </li>
      <li>Apply quantitative reasoning strategies to solve real-world problems with proportional 
        relationships using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percents as appropriate.</li>

    One of the most important natural resources that humans need for survival is water. An influential 
    United Nations report published in 2003 predicted that severe water shortages will affect 4 billion 
    people by 2050. This report also said that 40 percent of the world's population did not have access 
    to adequate sanitation facilities in 2003. Humans need clean water not just for drinking, but for 
    necessary tasks such as sanitation, growing food, and producing goods.

    You will use a measure of water consumption called a “water footprint” that includes all of the 
    ways that people use fresh water. According to Waterwiki.net, “The water footprint of an individual, 
    business, or nation is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods 
    and services consumed by the individual, business, or nation.” Goods are physical products such as 
    food, clothes, books, or cars. Services are types of work done by other people. Examples of services 
    are having your hair cut, having a mechanic fix your car, or having someone provide day care for 
    your children. Fresh water is often used to make goods and to provide you with services.

  <p>
    In this lesson, you are going to compare the populations of China, the United States, and India. You 
    will go on to look at the water footprint for each nation as a whole and per person (“per capita”) 
    to make some comparisons

        You will begin by thinking of various ways you can compare different countries' populations. 
        Scientific notation will be a useful tool because it is a way to write large numbers. Recall 
        that a number in scientific notation is written in the form: <m>M \times 10^n</m> where 
        <m>1 \leq M &lt; 10</m> and <m>n</m> is an integer.

              In 2014, the population of the United States was about 317 million, and Earth's population 
              was about 7.2 billion. Write these numbers in scientific notation.

              Write a ratio comparing the U.S. population to the world's population using a fraction.  
              Use a full sentence, and try to round to a reasonable amount.  Write a second sentence 
              using a percentage instead.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The population of the United States is the third largest in the world, exceeded only by China 
        and India.  Which country uses the most water?  Which country uses the most water per person?  
        We'll now explore this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table below gives the population and water footprints of China, India, and the United 
        States for 2011.  Notice the units used, given in the column labels.
