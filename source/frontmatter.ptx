    <p>
      I would like to dedicate this book to my son Benjamin, who was born on May 27, 2022. Benjamin's medical needs were the main reason this book was not ready on time, and yet he is so cute I can't stay mad at him.

      I would like to thank Grace College for providing me with a sabbatical in which to do the initial work to get this project off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also like to thank Heidi for her support and insightful feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, I must thank my mom for helping me find so many typos, just like old times.
