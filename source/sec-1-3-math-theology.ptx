    <commentary component="instructor">
      <p>In class, ask students to pair up and tell each other their math autobiographies.</p>
      <p>Then ask for students to summarize (i.e. bullet points) their partner's math autobiography in writing.</p>
      <p>Then ask the partners to check with each other that their summaries are okay.  They may need to fix something.</p>
      <p>Ask the class what Christian virtues were important during this activity.</p>

      For this set of activities you must work in a group of three or four people.  
      Find your group now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first part, we will consider what people from history have said about math, 
      and we try to consider math from our own Christian perspective.

        Why did God give people the capacity to do mathematics?  Before reading any 
        further, write a couple of sentences giving your answer to this question.
        If all you can think of is <q>I have no idea!</q>, take your best guess, 
        even if it seems silly to you.

    The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years.  They suggest 
    possible answers to the question of why we should study math.  Most are by famous and 
    influential people.  As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked 
    below, <q>What reason for studying math does this suggest?</q>  These quotes are rich 
    and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each.  
    You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we've done one as an example. 
    Note the column <q>Is this a good reason?</q> Some quotes provide reasons that are 
    partly good and partly bad.

    <introduction>
      <blockquote>
        <p><q>Whatever way [the geometer] may go, through exercise will he be lifted from the 
          physical to the divine teachings, which are little accessible because of the difficulty 
          to understand their meaning…and because of the circumstance that not everybody is able 
          to have a conception of them, especially not the one who turns away from the art of 
          demonstration.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>Why did al-Biruni think math was important?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Al-Biruni seems to be saying that understanding math can help us understand our creator.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Do you agree with al-Biruni?  Why or why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          On one hand, al-Biruni was Muslim, so his idea of <q>creator</q> was different from ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on the other hand, if we interpret his words from a Christian perspective, 
          we can agree that God wants us to know him. Understanding the order and beauty of God's 
          world can also help us understand God's order and beauty.
