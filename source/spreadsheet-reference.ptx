  <introduction>
    <p>
      A spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, is a very useful tool for doing calculations and making complex tables. You can type in your own custom calculations or use the built-in formulas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rectangles within a spreadsheet are called <em>cells</em>, and they can be referenced by their column letter and row number. The first cell in the upper left side highlighted below is A1. If we wanted to talk about the third column and the fifth row, that cell would be C5.

      A spreadsheet file can contain many sheets. Look along the bottom to see if there is more than one sheet and make sure you are on the right sheet.

    <title>Basic Calculations</title>
  
    <p>
      To do a calculation on a spreadsheet, type an equal sign before the operation. This lets the program know that you want it to calculate the result. When you press enter, you will see the result.
    </p>
    <example>
      <sidebyside valign="middle" widths="55% 25%">
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                To add 3 + 4, enter <c>=3+4</c>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To subtract 100-76, enter <c>=100-76</c>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To multiply 4 times 18, enter <c>=4*18</c>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To divide 0.05 by 12, enter <c>=0.05/12</c>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To calculate <m>5^{25}</m>, enter <c>=5^25</c>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

    </example>
    <p>
      Note that the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Spreadsheets don't recognize parentheses as indicators of multiplication like calculators do, so even if you have parentheses for the order of operations, the asterisk is also needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make more complicated mathematical expressions using parentheses and other operations. To <em>edit a cell</em> click on the editing box at the top, or double click on the cell to edit it directly. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Your bill at a restaurant is $35.75 and you want to leave an 18% tip. How much would you add to the bill? 
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
      <p>
        To work with a percentage, we need to convert it into a decimal first, and then multiply it by the base amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a spreadsheet we would type <cd>=0.18*35.75</cd>
      </p>
      <p>
        and get a result of $6.44, <em>rounded to the nearest cent</em>. You would leave a tip of $6.44.
      </p>

    <title>Cell References</title>
      <p>
        One of the powerful things about spreadsheets is using a cell reference, such as C5 in a calculation. When you use a <em>cell reference</em>, the values will automatically update if any of the referenced values change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's make a spreadsheet for the percentage tip example above. We calculated an 18% tip on a bill of $35.75. We might want to tip 18% in general, but our bill will change values. We labeled the first column Bill Amount and the second column Tip. The amount of $35.75 is entered in cell A2. Then when we write our formula in B2, we want to calculate 18% of A2. That way if the number in A2 changes, our tip will automatically update.

    <p>
      The formula <cd>=0.18*A2</cd> is entered in B2 which gives a result of $6.44 when you hit enter.

    <title>Cell Formatting</title>
    <p>
      We can also format cells A1 and B1 to show dollar signs by clicking on the dollar sign in the number formatting menu.

  <subsection>
    <title>Fill-Down Feature</title>
    <p>
      The <em>fill-down feature</em> is very useful for making tables. This allows us to copy values or formulas to save time. Let's make a tipping reference table with values from $10, to$100, in increments of $10. First, we will enter two values in column A to establish the pattern. Then select those two cells and you will see a small square in the lower right corner. Drag that square down until you get to $100.

    <p>
      Next, we can drag our formula down and the cell reference will change to each row number automatically.

    <title>Formulas</title>
    <p>
      Spreadsheets have many useful built-in formulas. We will introduce some of the financial formulas in this chapter. Here are some of the formulas we will use:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>=FV</c> to calculate the future values of an investment
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>=PV</c> to calculate the deposit needed for a desired future balance
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>=PMT</c> to calculate a loan or savings plan payment
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>=EFFECT</c> to calculate the effective rate of an account and compare accounts
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
