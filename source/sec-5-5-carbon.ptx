    <title>Carbon Dioxide Lab</title>

<introduction>
    <p>
      The goal for this lab is to learn about mathematical models related to carbon dioxide in 
      our atmosphere.  This lab deals specifically with linear, exponential, and periodic models.

        Imagine that three scientists look at the graph above and each scientist tries to fit a different model to the data.  The first scientist tries to fit a linear model to the data.  The second scientist tries to fit an exponential model to the data.  The third scientist tries to fit a periodic model to the data.  Follow this link: <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/byz3z1gibq"/> and help them fit their models to the data to the best of your ability using the sliders.

        For each hypothetical scientist, what does each of their models predict the carbon dioxide levels will be in the year 2060?

          <input>x = 2060</input>
        </console>
        <p>
          This will create a vertical line in the year 2060.  Click on each of the three points where it intersects the 
          scientists' three models.  This should display points whose y-coordinates match your answers to a. b. and c. above.
          (If they don't match, then you have a mistake somewhere).  Copy and paste a picture of these three points below.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Their answers will depend on their graph, so check that they are roughly consistent (as best you can).  I 
          usually just grade their graph, because their other answers are probably correct if their graph looks correct. 
          The main goal is for them to see that fitting a model to data usually creates a prediction of the future, and 
          different models can have wildly different predictions. 15 points.

    Scientists have only been measuring <m>\chem{CO_2}</m> at Mauna Loa since 1960.  However, scientists are able to drill 
    ice cores from glaciers to estimate the amount of <m>\chem{CO_2}</m> over the last 1000 years.  On the main graph below, 
    the red, solid line is the Mauna Loa data, and the black line is the data from ice cores of a glacier in Antartica.

    The following graphic is from a paper by
    <url href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/1999GL900070">Mann, Bradley, and Huges</url>.
      These scientists used information from tree rings, corals, ice cores, and historical records to reconstruct temperatures going back to 1000 A.D.  
      The gray shaded area represents uncertainty.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Why do you suppose that there is more uncertainty with the graph of temperature compared to the graph of carbon dioxide 
          levels? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Think about how they are measured.  The main source for temperature is tree ring data.  Is it as easy to tell the
          temperature from tree rings as it is to measure <m>\chem{CO_2}</m> trapped in layers of a glacier?

    The figure above has been described as the <q>hockey stick graph</q>, and there has been controversy around it.  An article in 
    <url href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/09/hockey-stick-graph-ipcc-report" >The Guardian</url>
    described some of the controversy:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Reconstructing past temperatures from proxy data is fraught with danger. Tree ring records, the biggest component of the 
      hockey stick record, sometimes reflect rain or drought rather than temperature. When I investigated the continuing row 
      surrounding the graph in 2006, Gordon Jacoby of Columbia University in New York, said: "Mann has a series from central 
      China that we believe is more a moisture signal than a temperature signal... He included it because he had a gap. That 
      was a mistake and it made tree-ring people angry." A large data set he used from bristlecone pines in the American west 
      has attracted similar concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deciding which data sets to include in such reconstructions was, if not arbitrary, then open to dispute. And dispute 
      there was. In the late 1990s, the researchers in heated debate about what they could and could not reliably show about past 
      temperatures, and how to represent their findings.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <exercise>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If some researchers dispute which tree ring data sets Mann, Bradley, and Hughes used, then why does it matter?

      </statement>
      <solution>

          Answers will vary.  I'm looking for the students to show that they understand that choosing which data 
          to consider can affect the average of the data. 5 points.

    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Because of the controversy the scientists were investigated by the EPA, Pennsylvania University (where Mann was a professor), the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the Inspector   General of the National Science Foundation. All of these institutions cleared them of any wrongdoing.

          Why does it matter that these institutions cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing?

          Answers will vary.  Grade on how much their answer makes sense, but be lenient or at least make helpful commments if you take
