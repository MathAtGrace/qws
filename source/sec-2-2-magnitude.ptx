  <title>Orders of Magnitude</title>
  <objectives>
    <ul>
      <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the magnitude of real numbers represented in many forms (fractions, decimals, scientific notation, square roots of numbers) by ordering and comparing them in mathematical and real-world contexts. </li>

  <introduction>
    <p>A large economic and political concern is the federal deficit, the amount of money spent by the 
      federal government in excess of revenue collected annually.  The federal budget deficit for 2015 
      was approximately $435 billion.  The federal debt is the accumulated deficits from all years, 
      and in 2015 was about $18.1 trillion.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to understand just how big a billion or a trillion is. Here is a way to 
      help you think about it.</p>

    <title>Scientific Notation</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>You saw that 1 billion can be written as 1,000,000,000 or represented as <m>10^9</m>.  
        How would 2 billion be represented?  Since 2 billion is 2 times 1 billion, then 2 billion 
        can be written as <m>2 \times 10^9</m>.  Writing numbers in this way is called scientific 
        notation.  Scientific notation is used primarily for writing very large numbers and very 
        small numbers.  In this lesson, we will focus on large numbers.</p>
      <p>The form for <term>scientific notation</term> is <m>M \times 10^n</m> where <m>1\leq M &lt; 10</m>.  
        The exponent equals the number of decimal places between the location of the decimal in the 
        number as written in standard notation and the number written in scientific notation.</p>
      <p>For example, if the number 500 were to be written in scientific notation, it could be thought 
        of as <m>5 \times 100</m> or <m>5 \times 10 \times 10</m> which is equal to <m>5 \times 10^2</m>.  
        The decimal point has been moved 2 places which corresponds to the exponent of 2.</p>
      <p>Likewise, if the number 4300 were to be written in scientific  notation, it could be thought 
        of as <m>4.3 \times 1000</m> or <m>4.3 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10</m> which is equal to 
        <m>4.3 \times 10^3</m>.  The decimal point has been moved 3 places (between 4300. and 4.3) 
        which corresponds to the exponent of 3.</p>
        <p>

        A writing principle that you will use throughout the course is given below followed by
