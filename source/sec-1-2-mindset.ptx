  <introduction>
    This section is based on a lesson created by the Kuyers Institute.

    <commentary component="instructor">
      <p>In class, ask students to pair up and tell each other their math 
          autobiographies.</p>
      <p>Then ask for students to summarize (i.e. bullet points) their partner's 
          math autobiography in writing.</p>
      <p>Then ask the partners to check with each other that their summaries 
          are okay.  They may need to fix something.</p>
      <p>Ask the class what Christian virtues were important during this 
          activity.</p>

    <p>For this worksheet you must work in a group of three or four people.  
        Find your group now.</p>
    <p>In the first part of this worksheet, we will consider what people 
        from history have said about math, and we try to consider math from 
        our own Christian perspective.</p>

        <statement>
          Why did God give people the capacity to do mathematics?  Before reading any further, write a couple of sentences giving your answer to this question.
          If all you can think of is <q>I have no idea!</q>, take your best guess, even if it seems silly to you.
        </statement>
      </exercise>

      <p>The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years.  They suggest possible answers to the question of why we should study math.  Most are by famous and influential people.  As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked below, <q>What reason for studying math does this suggest?</q>  These quotes are rich and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each.  You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we’ve done one as an example.  Note the column <q>Is this a good reason?</q> Some quotes provide reasons that are partly good and partly bad.

        <p><q>Whatever way [the geometer] may go, through exercise will he be lifted from the physical to the divine teachings, which are little accessible because of the difficulty to understand their meaning…and because of the circumstance that not everybody is able to have a conception of them, especially not the one who turns away from the art of demonstration.</q></p>

          <p>Example Answer: Even though al-Biruni was Muslim, if we interpret his words from a Christian perspective, we can agree that God wants us to know him. Understanding the order and beauty of God’s world can also help us understand God’s order and beauty.</p>
