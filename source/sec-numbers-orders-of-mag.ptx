    <title>Problem Situation: How Big is a Billion?</title>

    <page xml:id="orders-of-mag-worksheet-p1">
      <introduction>
        <p>A large economic and political concern is the federal deficit, the amount of money spent by the federal government in excess of revenue collected annually.  The federal budget deficit for 2015 was approximately $435 billion.  The federal debt is the accumulated deficits from all years, and in 2015 was about $18.1 trillion.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to understand just how big a billion or a trillion is. Here is a way to help you think about it.</p>

        <title>Problem Situation 2:  Scientific Notation</title>
        <introduction>
          <p>You saw that 1 billion can be written as 1,000,000,000 or represented as <m>10^9</m>.  How would 2 billion be represented?  Since 2 billion is 2 times 1 billion, then 2 billion can be written as <m>2 \times 10^9</m>.  Writing numbers in this way is called scientific notation.  Scientific notation is used primarily for writing very large numbers and very small numbers.  In this lesson, we will focus on large numbers.</p>
          <p><b>The form for scientific notation is <m>M \times 10^n</m> where <m>1\leq M &lt; 10</m>.</b>  The exponent equals the number of decimal places between the location of the decimal in the number as written in standard notation and the number written in scientific notation.</p>
          <p>For example, if the number 500 were to be written in scientific notation, it could be thought of as <m>5 \times 100</m> or <m>5 \times 10 \times 10</m> which is equal to <m>5 \times 10^2</m>.  The decimal point has been moved 2 places which corresponds to the exponent of 2.</p>
          <p>Likewise, if the number 4300 were to be written in scientific  notation, it could be thought of as <m>4.3 \times 1000</m> or <m>4.3 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10</m> which is equal to <m>4.3 \times 10^3</m>.  The decimal point has been moved 3 places (between 4300. and 4.3) which corresponds to the exponent of 3.</p>

      Below is a table that describes some large numbers in words, standard decimal notation, and scientific notation.  Notice how scientific notation keeps track of the number of decimal places to the right of the first digit, but before the decimal point.  Keeping track of the number of decimal places in quantities can be useful for some estimation problems.  Recall that if a number does not have a decimal point displayed, then the decimal point is assumed to be at the right end of the number.

    <p>
      The number of places you would move the decimal point in order to put a number in scientific notation can be used to describe the size of the number.  If the decimal point would be moved 6 places we say that number is <q>in the millions.</q>  If the decimal point would be moved 10 places we say the number is <q>in the tens of billions.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      To estimate with large numbers, we often round to a convenient place and then add or multiply the number as required.  Recall that if we round the number 145 to the ten's place we get 150, but if we round 145 to the hundred's place we get 100.  (If we rounded to the ten's and then rounded to the hundred's we would get a different answer: 200).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose we wanted a quick estimate of the yearly total expenses for a project in China that is expected to cost approximately \$10 for every person in the country per day.  By using estimates, we may be able to perform the calculations by hand reasonably quickly, as follows, to obtain a rough answer.  We could estimate the population of China as 1.5 billion, use the ten dollars per person, and estimate the number of days in a year as 350.  The product of these three numbers is
    </p>
    <me>
      350 \times 10 \times 1.5 \times 10^9
    </me>
    <p>
      If we leave off the <m>10^9</m> we get
    </p>
    <me>= 350 \times 15</me>
    <p>
      which is 10 times 350 plus another half of that: $3500 + 1750 = 5250$, so now we have
    </p>
    <me>
      5250 \times 10^9
    </me>
    <p>
      which is 5,250 billion or 5.25 trillion.  The simpler description is 5.25 trillion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that, when we say something like <q><m>\text{5,250} \times 10^9</m> is 5.250 billion</q> we are using these facts:
