    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-blue-area" workspace="0.5in">

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-area-change" workspace="0.5in">
      <statement>
        Try moving the <c>r</c> and <c>Y</c> sliders around.  Does the area of the blue region tend to stay the same, get larger, or get smaller as you make these changes?

    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-area-why" workspace="0.5in">
      <statement>
        Given what you know about how loans work, why would this be the case?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        For their explanation, mark correct if you can tell that they know that this is because the area of the blue region corresponds to the original principle. (2 points)
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-budget-700" workspace="0.5in">
      <statement>
        Suppose you have a budget for $700 a month for a home.  Also suppose that you can get an interest rate of 4%, and that you are looking for a 30 year loan.  Move the Principle <c>P</c> around to find the maximum house price you can afford.  What is it?  For this question, you will get full credit as long as you are close enough.  In order to get full credit, you need to be within $1,000 of the correct answer.  Make sure that you factor in that you will have to make escrow payments.
      </statement>
      <solution>
        Answer should be $120,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by, unless their answer is about $111,000, in which case take off 1 point becaused that means they were confused by escrow payments.
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-budget-700-percent-interest" workspace="0.5in">
      <statement>
        In the situation from the last exercise, what percentage of your money goes towards interest over the life of the loan?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        The amount of money going toward interest is 41.77% (2 point).  It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or their number is close enough.
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-budget-15-year" workspace="1in">
      <statement>
        Use the same information from <xref ref="exercise-mortgage-lab-budget-700" text="local">Exercise</xref>, but change the length of the loan to 15 years.  Now what is the maximum house price you can afford?  What now is the percentage of your money going towards interest?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <ol>
          <li>Answer should be $81,000 or $82,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by.</li>
          <li>The amount of money going toward interest is 24.80% (2 points).  It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or are close enough.</li>
        </ol>

      <statement>
        Given your answer to the exercise above, how would you explain to someone that a 15-year loan has less than twice the monthly payments of a 30 year loan?
      </statement>
      <solution>
        (6 points) Give at least 3 points for an answer that is coherent.  Give full credit for an explanation that basically says that paying off the loan faster means that less money goes toward interest.

    </exercise>
    <exercise xml:id="exercise-mortgage-lab-rising-interest" workspace="1in">
      <statement>
        Keeping everything else constant, change the annual percentage rate <c>r</c>.  Explain how a rising interest rate could be considered to make all home buyers a little poorer.
