    <title>Introduction to Dimensional Analysis</title>
    <p>Most numbers used in the real world have units attached, which clarify what the number is referring to. Examples of units are gallons, dollars, meters, miles, and pounds. Some units are for geometric measurements such as area or volume. Many disciplines such as medicine or engineering have special units for use in their field.</p>
    <p>This lesson will focus on a valuable strategy for converting from one set of units to another. <b>This skill is called dimensional analysis.</b>It is also known as unit analysis, unit-factor conversion, and the factor-label method.</p>
    <p>The dimensional analysis strategy is based on three familiar ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A fraction with equivalent expressions in the numerator and the denominator is equal to the number one. Examples:
        <me>\frac{3a}{3a}=1 \hspace{1in} \frac{2+5}{7}=1 \hspace{1in} \frac{7\text{ ft}^3}{7\text{ ft}^3} = 1</me>
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplying something by the number 1 does not change its value.  Example: 
        <me>\frac{\$4.99}{2 \text{ pounds}} \cdot 1 = \frac{\$4.99}{2 \text{ pounds}}</me>
        However, multiplying by the number 1 can be used to change the way a something appears. Example: to rewrite fifths as tenths:
        <me>\frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{8}{10}</me>
      </li>
      <li>
        When multiplying fractions, if a factor occurs in both the numerator and the denominator, it can be divided out. The common factor may be a number or a variable. Example:
        <me>\frac{3\text{g}}{7\text{m}} \cdot \frac{1\text{m}}{2} = \frac{3\text{g}}{14}</me>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key to unit conversions with dimensional analysis is multiplying by the number one in the form of a conversion fraction. Conversion fractions are fractions with different units in the numerator and denominator but in which the value of the numerator equals the value of the denominator. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since 3 feet is equal to 1 yard, the fraction <m>\dfrac{3 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ yard}}=1</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the fraction <m>\dfrac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ hour}}=1</m>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>To use the dimensional analysis method:</b></p>
    <p>Start with the original quantity and multiply it by the number 1 written as a conversion fraction of two units so that the units you <em>don't</em> want can divide out of the numerator and denominator.</p>
    <example xml:id="example-unit-conversion-1">
      <title>Convert 300 feet to yards</title>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with 300 feet</li>
        <li>
          Multiply by a conversion fraction with feet in the denominator (so that the <q>feet</q> divides out of both numerator and denominator), and in the numerator you want to have yards
          <me>300\text{ feet} \cdot \left( \frac{1\text{ yard}}{3 \text{ feet}}\right) = 300\cancel{\text{ feet}} \cdot \left( \frac{1\text{ yard}}{3 \cancel{\text{ feet}}}\right) = 100 \text{ yards}</me>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-unit-conversion-2">
      <title>Convert 30 ounces of weight to the metric unit of grams</title>
      <p>Determine conversion factors from the Unit Equivalencies table below, in the part for weight and mass.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with 30 ounces.</li>
        <li>Multiply by a conversion fraction with ounces in the denominator, and you'd like grams in the numerator. However, in the equivalencies table, it doesn't say how many ounces equals how many grams. But it does give equivalencies for ounces to pounds and then pounds to grams. So we use two conversion fractions.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              (30\text{ oz}) \cdot \frac{1\text{ lbs}}{16\text{ oz}} \cdot \frac{453.6\text{ g}}{1\text{ lbs}}
              \amp=(30\cancel{\text{ oz}}) \cdot \frac{1\cancel{\text{ lbs}}}{16\cancel{\text{ oz}}} \cdot \frac{453.6\text{ g}}{1\cancel{\text{ lbs}}}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\frac{30 \cdot 453.6 \text{ g}}{16}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=850.5 \text{ grams}</mrow>
          </md>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </example>
    <p>To create conversion fractions equal to 1, you must know which units are equivalent. The table on the below provides some unit equivalencies.</p>

    <title>Equivalences Table</title>
    <p>Notice the structure of the table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Units of the U.S. system are in the left column. Units of the Metric system are in the right column. The middle column shows some equivalencies between U.S. and metric units.</li>
      <li>Different types of measurements are in different rows: Length, Area, Capacity or Volume, Weight or Mass.</li>
      <li>When you want to find what a particular unit is equivalent to, you need to locate the unit in the correct row and column of the table.</li>

    <title>Metric Prefixes</title>
    <p>In the conversion table above, you'll notice that many of the units include prefixes like <q>milli</q> and <q>kilo</q>. While in English we use <q>millions</q>, <q>billions</q>, and <q>trillions</q> to represent large numbers, the metric system uses prefixes to indicate the size of a measurement. Like place values, these are based on powers of 10.</p>
    <p>For example, a meter is the standard measurement of length in metric, so 1000 meters would be 1 <b>kilo</b>meter. Likewise, 0.01 meters would be 1 <b>centi</b>meter (or, equivalently, 100 centimeters is 1 meter).</p>

    <title>Rates</title>
    <p>
      A ratio (that is, a fraction) that includes a unit in the numerator that is different from the unit in its denominator is typically called a “rate”.  Rates show how one variable changes for each change in the second variable.  For example, a rate of speed is <m>\dfrac{35\text{ mi}}{\text{hr}}</m> which can be read as 35 miles per hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word <q>per</q> is the fraction line, the division bar.  <q>Miles per hour</q> means miles divided by 1 hour.  Some common rates are abbreviated:
    </p>
    <p>
      <q>miles per hour</q> is often written as <q>mph</q>, and <q>miles per gallon</q> is often written as <q>mpg</q>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When doing calculations with a rate, it should be written as a fraction.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-miles-per-hour">
      <title>Converting speed</title>
      <statement>A bicycle is traveling at 12 miles per hour.  What is the speed in feet per second?</statement>
      <solution>
        <ul>
          <li>Start by writing the initial number as a fraction: <m>\dfrac{12\text{ miles}}{1\text{ hour}}</m></li>
          <li>
            We'll use 5280 ft = 1 mile to convert miles to feet.  To make this conversion, since <q>miles</q> is in the numerator of the original fraction, we'll need to put it in the denominator of our conversion so the units will cancel:
            <me>\frac{12\text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \cdot \frac{5280\text{ ft}}{1\text{ mile}} = \frac{63360\text{ ft}}{1\text{ hour}}</me>
            Notice that the <q>miles</q> will cancel, and units left are ft/hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            To convert the hours to seconds, we can use 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds.  Since our original fraction has hours in the denominator, we'll need to put hours in the numerator of our conversion so they'll cancel.  Likewise we'll set up the next conversion so the minutes units will cancel.  Then we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators, canceling all the units that cancel, and we're left with ft/sec:
            <me>
              \frac{63360\text{ ft}}{1\text{ hour}} \cdot \frac{1\text{ hour}}{60\text{ min}} \cdot \frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ sec}}
              =\frac{63360\text{ ft}}{3600\text{ sec}}
              =\frac{17.6\text{ ft}}{1\text{ sec}}
            </me>

    <title>Using Dimensional Analysis for Area and Volume units</title>
    <p>There are two methods of converting area and volume units:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use conversion factor of square units (or cubic units for volume).</li>
      <li>Use conversion factor of linear units, and square the conversion factor (or cube it for volume).</li>
    </ul>
    <example xml:id="example-convert-4-square-feet">
      <title>Convert 4 square feet to inches</title>
      <ul>
        <li>First write the question using symbols for the units:   Convert 4 ft<m>^2</m>  to  in<m>^2</m>.</li>
        <li>As with other unit conversions, we want to multiply 4 ft<m>^2</m>  by a conversion fraction with ft2  in the denominator and in2  in the numerator.  So we need to know how many ft<m>^2</m>  equal how many in<m>^2</m>.  You may not know this fact, which is fine because we can find it out from knowing the linear measurement equivalency that 1 ft = 12 in.  We will use that to find the area unit equivalency by squaring each side of the equation:
          <md>
            <mrow>1 \text{ ft} \amp= 12 \text{ in}</mrow>
            <mrow>(1 \text{ ft})^2 \amp= (12 \text{ in})^2</mrow>
            <mrow>1 \text{ ft}^2 \amp= 144 \text{ in}^2</mrow>

        <li>
          Now we know the area unit equivalency that 1 ft<m>^2</m> = 144 in<m>^2</m>.  We use that to create the conversion fraction and complete the unit conversion.
          <me>
            \left(4 \text{ ft}^2\right) \cdot \frac{144 \text{ in}^2}{1 \text{ ft}^2} = 576 \text{ in}^2
