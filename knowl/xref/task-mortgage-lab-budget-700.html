</h5>Suppose you have a budget for $700 a month for a home.  Also suppose that you can get an interest rate of 4%, and that you are looking for a 30 year loan.  Move the Principle <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">P</code> around to find the maximum house price you can afford.  What is it?  For this question, you will get full credit as long as you are close enough.  In order to get full credit, you need to be within $1,000 of the correct answer.  Make sure that you factor in that you will have to make escrow payments.<div class="solutions"><details class="solution solution-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like knowl__content">Answer should be $120,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by, unless their answer is about $111,000, in which case take off 1 point becaused that means they were confused by escrow payments.</div></details></div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-3-4-loans.html#task-mortgage-lab-budget-700">in-context</a></span>
