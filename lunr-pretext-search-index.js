  "body": " Time Management Lab   This worksheet borrows heavily from Quantway, which used material from Dartmouth University .  Students who make a decision to carefully schedule their time are not ones who have decided to spend all their time studying and doing nothing else. Instead, they usually have decided to efficiently use the time they have to spend studying and to \"de-sensitize\" themselves to the many distractions that are commonly occurring.  What is desensitizing? It means reducing the day-to-day and hour-to-hour decisions that you have to make about how to spend your time. Decisions such as whether or not you're going to spend the next hour studying, or whether you will or will not go to the math lab at the library to get work done today, or whether you will or will not go to a movie on impulse, or whether or not to use an hour between classes to get next week's homework assignment out of the way. If you have a plan for how to spend your time, then those decisions are already made for you!  Hence, a reasonable, well-thought-out time schedule can make decisions for you, thus desensitizing you to momentary distractions. And, an hour of study in one course is not disturbed by wondering when you will study for another course, or when you'll be able to get out and have some fun, because you've developed a plan, stuck to it, and can feel confident that you're doing what you need to in order to succeed in school. Create a master schedule (see below) and try to stick to it. It may take time, practice, and persistence. However, you'll most likely be amazed at how efficient you can become and how much time for “fun” stuff you might actually find yourself creating for yourself.    Rule of 60   Rule of 60   Before you do any detailed time management planning, it's useful to get a very general feeling of whether or not you've potentially overextended yourself when it comes to your time resources. One way to do this is by using the Rule of 60.     Multiply your session-credits by four and your semester-credits by two, and then add these two numbers together. By session-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of courses that only run for a session (i.e. session A or B)? By semester-credits, we mean how many credits are you taking right now in the form of classes that run the whole semester.  For example: Your answer should be something like if you're currently in two session-length courses and one semester-length course.    How many hours per week do you work, on average? How many hours per week do you participate in clubs or sports, on average? Add these hours together.    Add together your answers from parts a, b, and c.    A university study found that if this number is 60 or higher, you should NOT be surprised if you find yourself having academic difficulties. If you have a total higher than 60, this study found you are much more likely to struggle in school and become overwhelmed. This seems to be a general magic number for most students. It does not guarantee anything, but at least gives you an initial realistic idea of whether or not your schedule is manageable. Keep in mind that if you are taking math and\/or science, 60 may be too large and you may have to aim for lower hours since math\/science courses typically require more time. So, when you register for classes, take this into account. You're better off taking fewer credits now and being successful, as opposed to overloading yourself, failing, and slowing down your progress and momentum.      Master Calendar   Ten Steps to Developing a Master Calendar   One very important aspect of effectively managing your time is to set specific short term and long-term goals. You need to know what your goals are on a daily, weekly, and quarterly basis if you are going to be able to prioritize how you spend your time. It is important that you constantly review your goals, evaluate whether or not you are meeting them, and revise them accordingly. If you don't do this, and if you don't do it with honesty to yourself, you will find it more difficult to make good use of your time and attain your educational goals.  Read all of these directions before you make up your weekly schedule. Then make your schedule on paper or in a spreadsheet    Record Class Times in appropriate day\/hour blocks.  Record Work hours, Clubs and Sports hours, and Commute times.  Record all Regular Personal Activities such as meals, family duties, volunteer work, etc.  Record any Special Activities you need to do or want to do on a regular basis.  Schedule a Preview Time (5-30 minutes) immediately before each class whenever possible. During the preview time, review all or some of your notes in preparation for the upcoming class. Finish any reading assignments, if necessary. If you have two or three classes in a row, preview from last to first class. Use a P to indicate Preview. For example: P Math might mean you preview for your math class; P Math\/English means you are previewing two back-to-back classes.  Schedule a Review Time immediately after your classes (5-30 minutes) whenever possible. Use this time to edit and rework your notes, especially if you're using the 3-column method. For the schedule described above, you might write R: Math. You could also look over any assignments that were given and begin to plan when and how you will do them. Sketch those new assignments into your calendar if necessary.  Schedule your Intensive Study Time for each class. Try to schedule some study time each day for each class. Learning is more effectively and efficiently accomplished in shorter, regular sessions than in longer irregular sessions. When you schedule study time, be task-oriented rather than time-oriented. In other words, focused on what needs to get done for your classes (homework, reading, labs, WAMAP, etc.) Think in terms of \"blocks of time\" and what specifically needs to be accomplished, not hours of study time. Try to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective learning.  Schedule a Weekly Review (WR) for each course at the end of the week. Look at all of the past week's notes and assignments to see what you have been learning in the past week. Review your goals as well. You can also look ahead to plan the next week and determine how much to adjust your schedule to get it all done.  Keep open some time for regular Physical Activity. Research shows regular exercise gives you a general sense of well-being, and can reduce tension and help you accomplish a tough class, study, and work schedule. Also, label some empty blocks of time as Open for academic or personal needs.  Schedule some time during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for Free Time. Play, relax, or do whatever you want to do. This is your reward for sticking to your schedule. In addition, you'll enjoy your free time more.        Schedule   Weekly Schedule with room to fill in events.       Alternatively, you can also do this on a computer by filling out this spreadsheet     20 Tips for Managing Your Time    Create and maintain a Master Time Schedule. Give it a prominent place (binder cover) where you can see it easily and often. Revise it weekly during your Weekly Review time (see above).  Put up reminders in your home or office about your goals. Always keep your short and long-term goals in mind. Let them help you prioritize how you use your time.  Examine and revise your goals on a regular basis. Be sure to record progress towards those goals when you make it.  Count all your time as time to be used and make every attempt to get satisfaction out of every moment.  Find something to enjoy in whatever you do.  Remind yourself, \"There is always enough time for the important things.\" If it is important, you should be able to make time to do it.  Continually look at ways of freeing up your time.  Examine your old habits and search for ways to change or eliminate them.  Try to use waiting time¬¬ by review or reworking notes, reviewing flash cards, or doing practice problems.  Keep paper or a calendar with you to jot down the things you have to do or notes to yourself.  Plan your day each morning or the night before and set priorities for yourself.  Maintain and develop a list of specific things to be done each day, set your priorities and the get the most important ones done as soon in the day as you can. Evaluate your progress at the end of the day briefly.  Try rewarding yourself when you get things done as you had planned, especially the important ones.  When you catch yourself procrastinating-ask yourself, \"What am I avoiding?\" Deal with that head on.  Concentrate on one thing at a time.  Push yourself and be persistent, especially when you know you are doing well. In the end, you only have you to do this for you.  Be sure and set deadlines for yourself whenever possible.  Ask for advice when needed.  Try to find locations or environments where you can study effectively and therefore use your time efficiently. Experiment with different places to see what works best for you.  Stop regretting your failures and start learning from your mistakes. Mistakes are not an indication of personal failure but beginning points of understanding. Take time to reflect on them and think of ways to adopt new study strategies and habits that will avoid and reduce those mistakes over time. (Remember, this is a process!)     "

In class, ask students to pair up and tell each other their math autobiographies.  Then ask for students to summarize (i.e. bullet points) their partner's math autobiography in writing.  Then ask the partners to check with each other that their summaries are okay. They may need to fix something.  Ask the class what Christian virtues were important during this activity.  For this worksheet you must work in a group of three or four people. Find your group now.  In the first part of this worksheet, we will consider what people from history have said about math, and we try to consider math from our own Christian perspective.    God and Math Worksheet   Warm-up. Why did God give people the capacity to do mathematics? Before reading any further, write a couple of sentences giving your answer to this question. If all you can think of is I have no idea! , take your best guess, even if it seems silly to you.  The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years. They suggest possible answers to the question of why we should study math. Most are by famous and influential people. As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked below, What reason for studying math does this suggest? These quotes are rich and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each. You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we’ve done one as an example. Note the column Is this a good reason? Some quotes provide reasons that are partly good and partly bad.   Whatever way [the geometer] may go, through exercise will he be lifted from the physical to the divine teachings, which are little accessible because of the difficulty to understand their meaning…and because of the circumstance that not everybody is able to have a conception of them, especially not the one who turns away from the art of demonstration.  Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (al bee-ROO-nee), Uzbekistan, c. 1030 A.D. Preface to the Book on Finding the Chords in the Circle    Why did al-Biruni think math was important?  Example Answer: Al-Biruni seems to be saying that understanding math can help us understand our creator.    Do you agree with al-Biruni? Why or why not?  Example Answer: Even though al-Biruni was Muslim, if we interpret his words from a Christian perspective, we can agree that God wants us to know him. Understanding the order and beauty of God’s world can also help us understand God’s order and beauty.    Accurate reckoning. The entrance into the knowledge of all existing things and all obscure secrets.  Introduction to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, written in Egypt around 1850 B.C.   Why did Rhind Mathematical Papyrus think math was important?  Do you agree with what the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is saying? Why or why not?     You [God] have arranged all things by measure and number and weight.  ...Wherever you turn, Wisdom speaks to you through the imprint it has stamped upon its works.... Look at the sky, the earth, and the sea, and at whatever in them shines from above or crawls, flies, or swims below. These have form because they have number.  Augustine, North Africa, c. 400 AD De Genesi Contra Manichaeos, I (first line is quoting from the Wisdom of Solomon)   Why did Augustine think math was important?  Do you agree with what Augustine is saying? Why or why not?   In all those transactions which relate to worldly… (or) religious affairs, calculation is of use. In the science of love, in the science of wealth, in music and in the drama, in the art of cooking, and similarly in medicine and in things like the knowledge of architecture; in prose, in poetics and poetry, in logic and grammar and such other things,...the science of computation is held in high esteem. In relation to the movements of the sun and other heavenly bodies, in connection with eclipses and conjunction of the planets...it is utilized. The number, the diameter, and the perimeter of islands, oceans, and mountains; the extensive dimensions of the rows of habitations and halls belonging to the inhabitants of the world...all of these are made out by means of computation.  Mahavira’s (mah-hah-VEE-rah) Ganitasarasangraha, India, 9th century A.D.   Why did Mahavira think math was important?  Do you agree with what Mahavira is saying? Why or why not?   Now the science of mathematics is very important. This book ...therefore will be of great benefit to the people of the world. The knowledge for investigation, the development of intellectual power, the way of controlling the kingdom and of ruling even the whole world, can be obtained by those who are able to make good use of this book. Ought not those who have great desire to be learned take this with them and study it with great care?  Zhu Shijie (JOO shoor-jieh), China, 1303. The introduction to Precious Mirror of the Four Elements   Why did Zhu Shijie think math was important?  Do you agree with what Zhu Shijie is saying? Why or why not?     Since geometry is co-eternal with the divine mind before the birth of things, God himself served as his own model in creating the world (for what is there in God which is not God?), and he with his own image reached down to humanity.  Johannes Kepler, 1619. The Harmony of the World   Why did Kepler think math was important?  Do you agree with what Kepler is saying? Why or why not?   Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters triangles, circles, and other geometric figures with out which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.  Galileo Galilei, 1623. II Saggiatore   Why did Galileo think math was important?  Do you agree with what Galileo is saying? Why or why not?   The long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which geometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most difficult demonstrations led me to imagine that all things, to the knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, providing only that we abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another.  Rene Descartes (day-KART), France, 1637. Discourse on Method   Why did Descartes think math was important?  Do you agree with what Descartes is saying? Why or why not?     Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of paintings or music, yet sublimely pure and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.  Bertrand Russell, England, 1967. The Study of Mathematics: Philosophical Essays   Why did Russell think math was important?  Do you agree with what Russell is saying? Why or why not?   ...the most urgent social issue affecting poor people and people of color is economic access. In today's world, economic access and full citizenship depend crucially on math and science literacy. I believe that the absence of math literacy in urban and rural communities throughout this country is an issue as urgent as the lack of registered Black voters in Mississippi was in 1961.  Robert P Moses, United States, 2001. Radical Equations: Math Literacy and Civil Rights   Why did Robert Moses think math was important?  Do you agree with what Robert Moses is saying? Why or why not?   So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth  Genesis 1:27–28   Genesis 1:27-28 What are the main ideas of this passage?  Genesis 1:27-28 What might this statement have to do with how we think about math?     Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her. Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed.  By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place; by his knowledge the watery depths were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.

He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.  Colossians 1:15–17   Colossians 1:15–17 What are the main ideas of this passage?

  "body": " God and Math    Interact with different philosophical and theological views of mathematics  Discuss philosophical and theological view of mathematics with peers     This section is based on a lesson created by the Kuyers Institute.  In class, ask students to pair up and tell each other their math autobiographies.  Then ask for students to summarize (i.e. bullet points) their partner's math autobiography in writing.  Then ask the partners to check with each other that their summaries are okay. They may need to fix something.  Ask the class what Christian virtues were important during this activity.  For this set of activities you must work in a group of three or four people. Find your group now.  In the first part, we will consider what people from history have said about math, and we try to consider math from our own Christian perspective.     Why did God give people the capacity to do mathematics? Before reading any further, write a couple of sentences giving your answer to this question. If all you can think of is I have no idea! , take your best guess, even if it seems silly to you.    The following statements have been made during the past 4,000 years. They suggest possible answers to the question of why we should study math. Most are by famous and influential people. As you read each one, fill in the first column of the table linked below, What reason for studying math does this suggest? These quotes are rich and many good things could be said about them, so aim for one good point for each. You will work in groups to fill in the rest of each row; we've done one as an example. Note the column Is this a good reason? Some quotes provide reasons that are partly good and partly bad.     Whatever way [the geometer] may go, through exercise will he be lifted from the physical to the divine teachings, which are little accessible because of the difficulty to understand their meaning…and because of the circumstance that not everybody is able to have a conception of them, especially not the one who turns away from the art of demonstration.  Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (al bee-ROO-nee), Uzbekistan, c. 1030 A.D.  Preface to the Book on Finding the Chords in the Circle     Why did al-Biruni think math was important?   Al-Biruni seems to be saying that understanding math can help us understand our creator.    Do you agree with al-Biruni? Why or why not?   On one hand, al-Biruni was Muslim, so his idea of creator was different from ours.  But on the other hand, if we interpret his words from a Christian perspective, we can agree that God wants us to know him. Understanding the order and beauty of God's world can also help us understand God's order and beauty.       Accurate reckoning. The entrance into the knowledge of all existing things and all obscure secrets.  Introduction to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, written in Egypt around 1850 B.C.     Why did Rhind Mathematical Papyrus think math was important?    Do you agree with what the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is saying? Why or why not?       You [God] have arranged all things by measure and number and weight.  ...Wherever you turn, Wisdom speaks to you through the imprint it has stamped upon its works.... Look at the sky, the earth, and the sea, and at whatever in them shines from above or crawls, flies, or swims below. These have form because they have number.  Augustine, North Africa, c. 400 AD De Genesi Contra Manichaeos, I (first line is quoting from the Wisdom of Solomon)     Why did Augustine think math was important?    Do you agree with what Augustine is saying? Why or why not?      In all those transactions which relate to worldly… (or) religious affairs, calculation is of use. In the science of love, in the science of wealth, in music and in the drama, in the art of cooking, and similarly in medicine and in things like the knowledge of architecture; in prose, in poetics and poetry, in logic and grammar and such other things,...the science of computation is held in high esteem. In relation to the movements of the sun and other heavenly bodies, in connection with eclipses and conjunction of the planets...it is utilized. The number, the diameter, and the perimeter of islands, oceans, and mountains; the extensive dimensions of the rows of habitations and halls belonging to the inhabitants of the world...all of these are made out by means of computation.  Mahavira's (mah-hah-VEE-rah) Ganitasarasangraha, India, 9th century A.D.     Why did Mahavira think math was important?    Do you agree with what Mahavira is saying? Why or why not?       Now the science of mathematics is very important. This book ...therefore will be of great benefit to the people of the world. The knowledge for investigation, the development of intellectual power, the way of controlling the kingdom and of ruling even the whole world, can be obtained by those who are able to make good use of this book. Ought not those who have great desire to be learned take this with them and study it with great care?  Zhu Shijie (JOO shoor-jieh), China, 1303. The introduction to Precious Mirror of the Four Elements     Why did Zhu Shijie think math was important?    Do you agree with what Zhu Shijie is saying? Why or why not?       Since geometry is co-eternal with the divine mind before the birth of things, God himself served as his own model in creating the world (for what is there in God which is not God?), and he with his own image reached down to humanity.  Johannes Kepler, 1619. The Harmony of the World     Why did Kepler think math was important?    Do you agree with what Kepler is saying? Why or why not?       Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe, which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters triangles, circles, and other geometric figures with out which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.  Galileo Galilei, 1623. II Saggiatore     Why did Galileo think math was important?    Do you agree with what Galileo is saying? Why or why not?       The long chains of simple and easy reasonings by means of which geometers are accustomed to reach the conclusions of their most difficult demonstrations led me to imagine that all things, to the knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, providing only that we abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another.  Rene Descartes (day-KART), France, 1637. Discourse on Method     Why did Descartes think math was important?    Do you agree with what Descartes is saying? Why or why not?       Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of paintings or music, yet sublimely pure and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.  Bertrand Russell, England, 1967. The Study of Mathematics: Philosophical Essays     Why did Russell think math was important?    Do you agree with what Russell is saying? Why or why not?       ...the most urgent social issue affecting poor people and people of color is economic access. In today's world, economic access and full citizenship depend crucially on math and science literacy. I believe that the absence of math literacy in urban and rural communities throughout this country is an issue as urgent as the lack of registered Black voters in Mississippi was in 1961.  Robert P Moses, United States, 2001. Radical Equations: Math Literacy and Civil Rights     Why did Robert Moses think math was important?   By economic access he means the ability to get a good job. Some students' answers in the past have been distracted by the abstract economy and failed to mention the real people Robert Moses was referring to.    Do you agree with what Robert Moses is saying? Why or why not?       So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth  Genesis 1:27-28     What are the main ideas of this passage?    What might this statement have to do with how we think about math?   If you are focussing on the word multiply, then you missed the point.       Proverbs 3:13-20   Blessed are those who find wisdom,  those who gain understanding,  for she is more profitable than silver  and yields better returns than gold.  She is more precious than rubies;  nothing you desire can compare with her.  Long life is in her right hand;  in her left hand are riches and honor.  Her ways are pleasant ways,  and all her paths are peace.  She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;  those who hold her fast will be blessed.    By wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations,  by understanding he set the heavens in place;  by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,  and the clouds let drop the dew.      What are the main ideas of this passage?    What might this statement have to do with how we think about math?   If you are focussing on the word divided , then you missed the point.       He [Christ] is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.  Colossians 1:15-17     What are the main ideas of this passage?    What might this statement have to do with how we think about math?

Work in your groups to find an answer to present to the class. This problem was orignally posed to the author by Dr. Ben Markham in a QR Faculty Workshop in October, 2018.   Here are some statistics that may or may not be helpful:   3 Years: The average time a person sits on the toilet in a lifetime. Some much longer.  384 trees are cut to provide toilet paper for one American's lifetime.  810 rolls of toilet paper are produced from one average tree.  Worldwide, products made from almost 270,000 trees are sent to landfills every day, Worldwide Fund for Nature reports. Roughly 10 percent of that total is attributable to toilet paper.  The average American uses 57 sheets of toilet paper per day.  Name brand TP is a preference for only 50% of consumers, while 35% reported that they didn't have a preference, and 15% said they didn't know how to answer the question.  7% of American steal toilet paper from hotels. Really? C'mon people.  Toilet paper squares are usually 4 inches long.  Sales in the United States of what the industry calls \"luxury\" rolls - anything quilted, lotioned, perfumed or ultra-soft, from two- to four-ply - climbed to $1.4 billion in 2014, says Euromonitor International show. This segment is fastest growing segment of industry.  There are approximately 325 million people in the United States of America.  The circumference of the earth at the equator is almost 25,000 miles.          In this lesson, you will learn how to evaluate information you see often in society. You will start with the following situation.   Problem Situation: Does This Information Make Sense?   You are traveling down the highway and see a billboard with this message:       Every year since 1950, the number of American children gunned down has doubled.        You do not see the name of the organization that put up the billboard. What groups might have wanted to publish this statement? What are some social issues or political ideas that this statement might support?      This question does not have a \"right\" answer, or even a numerical answer. The goal here is for you to think about the question, and write up a response. You will earn full credit as long as your answer is reasonable and on-topic.  The information in this statement is called quantitative . Quantitative information uses concepts about quantity or number. This can be specific numbers or a pattern based on numerical relationships such as doubling.  You hear and see statements using quantitative information every day. People use these statements as evidence to convince you to do things like   vote a certain way  donate or give money to a cause  understand a health risk   You often do not know whether these statements are true. You may not be able to locate the information, but you can start by asking if the statement is reasonable. This means to ask if the statements make sense. You will be asked if information is reasonable throughout this course. This lesson will help you understand what is meant by this question.    In 1995, an article published the statement in the Problem Situation. Do you think this was a reasonable statement to make in 1995? (At this point, this should be an unjustified opinion, based on your intuition)  You only have the information in the statement. Using only that information, how can you decide if the statement is reasonable? (Focus on quantitative (numerical) approaches)        To keep things simple, suppose the number of children in 1950 was 1 child. We could use any starting point, but this is a very easy number to work with. Using the problem situation statement that the number doubled every year since 1950, determine the number of children the statement claims were gunned down in the next few years after 1950.       Year  Number of Children    1950  1    1951     1952     1953     1954     1955        Now, determine how many children this predicts for 1960. Try to figure it out without multiplying by 2 ten times.    Earlier, you thought about ways to decide if the problem situation statement was reasonable. One approach is to pick a starting number and see what the statement predicts. Complete the following table.  In the third column, choose the most appropriate place value and round to the nearest whole value for that place value. For example, if you had 3,125, you'd round that to 3 thousand.         Year  Number of Children  Rounded (using words)    1950  1     1960      1970      1980      1990      1995         Based on your calculations above, does the original statement from the problem situation seem reasonable?

A large economic and political concern is the federal deficit, the amount of money spent by the federal government in excess of revenue collected annually. The federal budget deficit for 2015 was approximately $435 billion. The federal debt is the accumulated deficits from all years, and in 2015 was about $18.1 trillion.  It is difficult to understand just how big a billion or a trillion is.

Imagine a stack of 1,000 one-dollar bills, which is about 4.3 inches tall. Imagine combining 1,000 stacks of 1,000 one-dollar bills. How much money is in the stack, and how tall (in feet) would it be?    Try to come up with a well-known or common thing that is basically the same height or length as your answer to .

Try to come up with a well-known or common thing that is basically the same height or length as your answer to . Feel free to use the internet.    Now imagine combining 1000 stacks like the one above in . How much money is in the stack, and how tall (in miles) would it be?    Since the circumference of the earth is a litte less then 25,000 miles, how many times would this stack from go around the world?    Your friends are discussing an entertainment strike (actor's guild, baseball, hockey, whatever your friends care about most) where the professionals, who are generally millionaires, are against the owners, who are generaly billionaires. Try to to explain the difference between a million and a billion in a simple but also insightful way to your friends.       Scientific Notation   You saw that 1 billion can be written as 1,000,000,000 or represented as . How would 2 billion be represented? Since 2 billion is 2 times 1 billion, then 2 billion can be written as . Writing numbers in this way is called scientific notation. Scientific notation is used primarily for writing very large numbers and very small numbers. In this lesson, we will focus on large numbers.  The form for scientific notation is where . The exponent equals the number of decimal places between the location of the decimal in the number as written in standard notation and the number written in scientific notation.  For example, if the number 500 were to be written in scientific notation, it could be thought of as or which is equal to . The decimal point has been moved 2 places which corresponds to the exponent of 2.  Likewise, if the number 4300 were to be written in scientific notation, it could be thought of as or which is equal to . The decimal point has been moved 3 places (between 4300. and 4.3) which corresponds to the exponent of 3.     Write the numbers below in both standard notation and scientific notation.      Words  Standard Notation  Scientific Notation    four hundred          twenty three thousand          7.2 million              The table below contains the national deficit and national debt for various years.

A writing principle that you will use throughout the course is given below followed by the questions below, which give you examples of how to use this principle.   Writing Principle: Use specific and complete information. The reader should understand what you are trying to say even if they have not read the question or writing prompt. This includes    information about context, and  quantitative information       A headline in 2014 read “Scott vetoes $69 million in $77-billion state budget”. Is the $69 million a small or large portion of the total state budget? The following four statements are all correct. Which statement provides the best description, based on the writing principle?  The portion vetoed is a very small part of the entire state budget.  $69 million is about a thousandth of $77 billion.  The $69 million vetoed is a very small part of the entire state budget of $77 billion.  The $69 million that was vetoed is about one tenth of one percent of the total $77 billion state budget.      The federal budget in 2012 included $471 billion for Medicare and $47 billion for International Affairs. Complete the statement below that compares the two quantities.  The budget of $471 billion for Medicare is about times larger than the $47 billion budget for International Affairs.      Using the writing principle above, in a full sentence compare the 2009 deficit and the 2014 deficit from exercise 9.        Estimate, then Calculate   For each situation below, describe your estimation strategy for each situation. Then estimate without a calculator . Then and only then go back use a calculator to refine your estimate.     About 3 million working people in the U.S. make at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Estimate the amount of money needed per year to raise their wages to $15 per hour.    The amount of money needed to buy everyone in your state a box of Girl Scout cookies.    The amount of money needed to send all graduating high school seniors in the United States to college for four years.    If the U.S. national debt was $22 trillion in 2019, and was evenly divided among the people living in the United States, how much would each person's share be?    If the U.S. budget is about $4.1 trillion, estimate the percentage of the budget which would be needed to pay for your estimate in above.       "

Apply quantitative reasoning strategies to solve real-world problems with proportional relationships using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percents as appropriate.    One of the most important natural resources that humans need for survival is water. An influential United Nations report published in 2003 predicted that severe water shortages will affect 4 billion people by 2050. This report also said that 40 percent of the world's population did not have access to adequate sanitation facilities in 2003. Humans need clean water not just for drinking, but for necessary tasks such as sanitation, growing food, and producing goods.  You will use a measure of water consumption called a “water footprint” that includes all of the ways that people use fresh water. According to Waterwiki.net, “The water footprint of an individual, business, or nation is defined as the total volume of freshwater that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual, business, or nation.” Goods are physical products such as food, clothes, books, or cars. Services are types of work done by other people. Examples of services are having your hair cut, having a mechanic fix your car, or having someone provide day care for your children. Fresh water is often used to make goods and to provide you with services.  In this lesson, you are going to compare the populations of China, the United States, and India. You will go on to look at the water footprint for each nation as a whole and per person (“per capita”) to make some comparisons   Comparing Populations   You will begin by thinking of various ways you can compare different countries' populations. Scientific notation will be a useful tool because it is a way to write large numbers. Recall that a number in scientific notation is written in the form: where and is an integer.     In 2014, the population of the United States was about 317 million, and Earth's population was about 7.2 billion. Write these numbers in scientific notation.    Write a ratio comparing the U.S. population to the world's population using a fraction. Use a full sentence, and try to round to a reasonable amount. Write a second sentence using a percentage instead.    Circle the statement that describes your result from the exercise above.  The world population is % larger than the U.S. population.  The U.S. population is % of the world population.  The U.S. population is % smaller than the world population.  The world population is % of the U.S. population.      In 2014, the population of China was 1.39 billion. Compare China's 2014 population to the world population with a ratio. Using full sentences, write your answer as a fraction, and as a percent.    Determine the ratio needed to complete this statement. Below, explain why you rounded the way that you did. The population of China is times the population of the United States.         Comparing Water Footprints   The population of the United States is the third largest in the world, exceeded only by China and India. Which country uses the most water? Which country uses the most water per person? We'll now explore this.  The table below gives the population and water footprints of China, India, and the United States for 2011. Notice the units used, given in the column labels.   Water Footprint of US, China, and India in 2011       Country  Population in 2011 (in millions)   Total Water Footprint in 2011  (in cubic meters per year)     China  1,344  1,368    India  1,250  1,144    United States  312  821        Re-write the information from the table above in standard notation and in scientific notation in complete sentences. For example, The population of China in 2011 was aproximately 1,344,000,000 ( ) people.     We are interested in the amount of water used on average by each person in the country. This is the Water footprint per person (which is the same as water footprint per capita ) for each country. Compute this for each country, rounding using your best judgment, and give your answer as a complete sentence.   Use complete sentences to answer the following questions:   Which country has the largest total water footprint?    Which country has the largest per person water footprint?    Which country has the smallest total water footprint?    Which country has the smallest per person water footprint?    Determine the ratio needed to complete this statement.

  "body": " Unit Conversion    4. Use dimensional analysis to convert units, rates, and ratios from any given units to other units. Include conversions among and between U.S. and metric units using a variety of metric prefixes.     Introduction to Dimensional Analysis  Most numbers used in the real world have units attached, which clarify what the number is referring to. Examples of units are gallons, dollars, meters, miles, and pounds. Some units are for geometric measurements such as area or volume. Many disciplines such as medicine or engineering have special units for use in their field.  This lesson will focus on a valuable strategy for converting from one set of units to another. This skill is called dimensional analysis. It is also known as unit analysis, unit-factor conversion, and the factor-label method.  The dimensional analysis strategy is based on three familiar ideas:   A fraction with equivalent expressions in the numerator and the denominator is equal to the number one. Examples:   Multiplying something by the number 1 does not change its value. Example: However, multiplying by the number 1 can be used to change the way a something appears. Example: to rewrite fifths as tenths:   When multiplying fractions, if a factor occurs in both the numerator and the denominator, it can be divided out. The common factor may be a number or a variable. Example:    The key to unit conversions with dimensional analysis is multiplying by the number one in the form of a conversion fraction. Conversion fractions are fractions with different units in the numerator and denominator but in which the value of the numerator equals the value of the denominator. Examples:   Since 3 feet is equal to 1 yard, the fraction .  Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the fraction .   To use the dimensional analysis method:  Start with the original quantity and multiply it by the number 1 written as a conversion fraction of two units so that the units you don't want can divide out of the numerator and denominator.   Convert 300 feet to yards   Start with 300 feet  Multiply by a conversion fraction with feet in the denominator (so that the feet divides out of both numerator and denominator), and in the numerator you want to have yards      Convert 30 ounces of weight to the metric unit of grams  Determine conversion factors from the Unit Equivalencies table below, in the part for weight and mass.  If we start with 30 ounces and multiply by two versions of 1, one to convert pounds to ounces and the other to convert pounds to grams, we get      To create conversion fractions equal to 1, you must know which units are equivalent. The table on the below provides some unit equivalencies.    Equivalences Table  Notice the structure of the table:   Units of the U.S. system are in the left column. Units of the Metric system are in the right column. The middle column shows some equivalencies between U.S. and metric units.  Different types of measurements are in different rows: Length, Area, Capacity or Volume, Weight or Mass.  When you want to find what a particular unit is equivalent to, you need to locate the unit in the correct row and column of the table.          Unit Equivalencies:  USCS (US Customary System)    Unit Equivalencies:  USCS Metric     Unit Equivalencies:  Metric or SI           Length     12 inches (in) = 1 foot (ft)  3 feet (ft) = 1 yard (yd)  1760 yards (yd) = 1 mile (mi)  5280 feet (ft) = 1 mile (mi)    1 inch (in) = 2.54 centimeters (cm)  0.62 miles (mi) = 1 kilometer (km)    1000 millimeters (mm) = 1 meter (m)  1000 meters (m) = 1 kilometer (km)  100 centimeters (cm) = 1 meter (m)          Area     1 square mile (mi )= 640 acre (ac)  1 acre (ac) = 43,560 square feet (ft )    2.471 acre (ac) = 1 hectare (ha)  1 square mile (mi ) = 2.59 square kilometers (km )    1 square kilometer (km ) = 100 hectare (ha)  1 hectare (ha) = 10,000 square meters (m )          Volume     8 ounces (oz) = 1 cup (c)  2 cups (c) = 1 pint (pt)  2 pints (pt) = 1 quart (qt)  4 quarts (qt) = 1 gallon (gal)  1 cubic foot (ft )=7.481 gallons (gal)    1 quart (qt) = 0.946 liters (L)    1000 milliliters (ml) = 1 liter (L)  1000 liters (L) = 1 cubic meter (m )          Weight or Mass     16 ounces (oz) = 1 pounds (lb)  2000 pounds (lb) = 1 ton    2.20 pounds (lb) = 1 kilogram (kg)  1 pound (lb) = 453.6 grams (g)    1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)  1000 grams (g) = 1 kilogram (kg)  1000 kilograms = 1 metric ton        Metric Prefixes  In the conversion table above, you'll notice that many of the units include prefixes like milli and kilo . While in English we use millions , billions , and trillions to represent large numbers, the metric system uses prefixes to indicate the size of a measurement. Like place values, these are based on powers of 10.  For example, a meter is the standard measurement of length in metric, so 1000 meters would be 1 kilo meter. Likewise, 0.01 meters would be 1 centi meter (or, equivalently, 100 centimeters is 1 meter).

In the US, we measure height in feet and inches. In other parts of the world, height is measured in meters. Use dimensional analysis to convert the height of a person who is 5 feet, 10 inches into meters.    In the US, we measure weight in pounds. In other parts of the world, weight is measured in kilograms. Use dimensional analysis to convert the weight of a person who is 180 pounds into kilograms.    A pesticide is supposed to be diluted in water at the rate of 2 pounds per gallon. Use dimensional analysis to convert this to ounces per quart.         Rates  A ratio (that is, a fraction) that includes a unit in the numerator that is different from the unit in its denominator is typically called a “rate”. Rates show how one variable changes for each change in the second variable. For example, a rate of speed is which can be read as 35 miles per hour.  The word per is the fraction line, the division bar. Miles per hour means miles divided by 1 hour. Some common rates are abbreviated:   miles per hour is often written as mph , and miles per gallon is often written as mpg .  When doing calculations with a rate, it should be written as a fraction.   Converting speed  A bicycle is traveling at 12 miles per hour. What is the speed in feet per second?    Start by writing the initial number as a fraction:  We'll use 5280 ft = 1 mile to convert miles to feet. To make this conversion, since miles is in the numerator of the original fraction, we'll need to put it in the denominator of our conversion so the units will cancel: Notice that the miles will cancel, and units left are ft\/hour.  To convert the hours to seconds, we can use 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. Since our original fraction has hours in the denominator, we'll need to put hours in the numerator of our conversion so they'll cancel. Likewise we'll set up the next conversion so the minutes units will cancel. Then we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators, canceling all the units that cancel, and we're left with ft\/sec:       Converting flow  Flow rate can be measured in cubic meters per hour. If a river flows at 200 cubic meters per hour, what is the flow rate in gallons per second?    Start with 200 cubic meters per hour which can be written as   Then multiply by conversion fractions so that units you don’t want in the end will cancel. To form the conversion fractions find equivalent units for capacity or volume from the table.    Multiply numbers in the numerator, divide by numbers in the denominator. In your calculator enter 200 x 1000 \/ 0.946 \/ 4 \/ 60 \/ 60 enter.  Or, on a calculator that can display multiple operations at once, you could use parentheses and enter (200 * 1000) \/ (0.946 * 4 * 60 * 60)   Notice the 200 is not cubed (it is the unit m that is cubed).      Texting While Driving   Indiana state law says:  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), a person may not hold or use a telecommunications device while operating a moving motor vehicle.  (b) A telecommunications device may be used in conjunction with hands free or voice operated technology.  (c) A telecommunications device may be used or held to call 911 to report a bona fide emergency.    Is texting while driving actually a problem? A person might spend only 4 seconds to answer a text. How far would the car go in that time? It depends on the car's speed.     Suppose a car is traveling at 35 miles per hour. Before calculating, give an educated guess for the distance, in feet, the car will travel in 4 seconds.    Suppose a car is traveling at 35 miles per hour. Use dimensional analysis to calculate the distance, in feet, the car will travel in 4 seconds.    If you are driving in Canada, following the posted speed limit of 80 km\/hr, how many feet would you go during the 4 seconds spent texting?    Suppose the typical texting response time is between 2 seconds and 6 seconds. That could be written as a compound inequality for time t as: seconds.  If a car is travelling at 35 mph, what is the typical distance a car would travel during a typical texting response?         Using Dimensional Analysis for Area and Volume units  There are two methods of converting area and volume units:   Use conversion factor of square units (or cubic units for volume).  Use conversion factor of linear units, and square the conversion factor (or cube it for volume).    Convert 4 square feet to inches   First write the question using symbols for the units: Convert 4 ft to in .  As with other unit conversions, we want to multiply 4 ft by a conversion fraction with ft2 in the denominator and in2 in the numerator. So we need to know how many ft equal how many in . You may not know this fact, which is fine because we can find it out from knowing the linear measurement equivalency that 1 ft = 12 in. We will use that to find the area unit equivalency by squaring each side of the equation:    These diagrams giving the geometric view of the algebra. Each of these is one square foot. Find the area by taking length times width.   Picture of square foot measured two ways    Now we know the area unit equivalency that 1 ft = 144 in . We use that to create the conversion fraction and complete the unit conversion.      Convert 4 square feet to inches, again with the other method   First re-write in symbols: Convert 4 ft to in .   We want to multiply 4 ft by a conversion fraction with ft in the denominator and in in the numerator. If we could find a conversion factor for feet in the denominator and inches in the numerator, then we could square that entire fraction so we’d end up with square units. The linear measurement equivalency that 1 ft = 12 in. So we’ll use square the fraction (12 in\/1ft).       Convert 3,000,000 cubic centimeter to cubic meters.   First write the question using symbols for the units: Convert 4 ft to in .  We want to multiply 4 ft by a conversion fraction with ft in the denominator and in in the numerator. If we could find a conversion factor for feet in the denominator and inches in the numerator, then we could square that entire fraction so we’d end up with square units. The linear measurement equivalency that 1 ft = 12 in. So we’ll use square the fraction (12 in\/1ft).      Convert 3,000,000 cubic centimeter to cubic meters, again with the other method   First re-write in symbols: convert 3,000,000 cm to m .  Find a conversion fraction for cm in the denominator and m in the numerator, and then cube that fraction. We know 1 m = 100 cm, so use the conversion fraction (1m \/ 100 cm) and cube it.      Convert 100 m to square feet using linear equivalencies     Length, Area, Volume   While helping a friend remodel their house in Canada, you realize you brought your American tape measure. You measure the living room to be 12 feet wide and 14 feet 6 inches long.     To buy baseboard for the remodel, you need to know the length and width of the room in meters (since the local hardware store sells in meter lengths). Convert the width and length of the room to meters. You measure the width as 12 feet and the length as 14 ft and 6 inches.    Flooring is priced by the square meter. To determine how much carpet to buy for the living room, you need to know the area of the room. Find the area in square meters.    To buy an appropriately sized fan for the bathroom, you need to estimate the volume of the room. You measure the bathroom to be 8 ft wide, 10 ft long, with 8 ft tall ceilings. Determine the volume of the bathroom, in cubic meters.    We breathe about 10 liters of air each minute while being fairly still How many cubic feet of air do we breathe each hour?        "

  "body": " Texting While Driving   Indiana state law says:  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), a person may not hold or use a telecommunications device while operating a moving motor vehicle.  (b) A telecommunications device may be used in conjunction with hands free or voice operated technology.  (c) A telecommunications device may be used or held to call 911 to report a bona fide emergency.    Is texting while driving actually a problem? A person might spend only 4 seconds to answer a text. How far would the car go in that time? It depends on the car's speed.     Suppose a car is traveling at 35 miles per hour. Before calculating, give an educated guess for the distance, in feet, the car will travel in 4 seconds.    Suppose a car is traveling at 35 miles per hour. Use dimensional analysis to calculate the distance, in feet, the car will travel in 4 seconds.    If you are driving in Canada, following the posted speed limit of 80 km\/hr, how many feet would you go during the 4 seconds spent texting?    Suppose the typical texting response time is between 2 seconds and 6 seconds. That could be written as a compound inequality for time t as: seconds.  If a car is travelling at 35 mph, what is the typical distance a car would travel during a typical texting response?      "

To determine how much carpet to buy for the living room, you need to know the area of the room. Find the area in square meters.    To buy an appropriately sized fan for the bathroom, you need to estimate the volume of the room. You measure the bathroom to be 8 ft wide, 10 ft long, with 8 ft tall ceilings. Determine the volume of the bathroom, in cubic meters.    We breathe about 10 liters of air each minute while being fairly still How many cubic feet of air do we breathe each hour?      "

Labor  4 hours @ $45 per hour       Gerry came to their house and said that the job would take about four hours and would cost about $600.     Using the area of the backyard, determine how much the job should cost, based on the advertised prices. Assume you have to buy full pounds of grass seed and fertilizer.    Is Gerry's estimate of $600 consistent with the prices in his advertisement?          The backyard is 130*115 + 10*55 = 15500 square feet. 62 pounds of grass seed at $3.50 each is $217. 45 pounds of fertilizer at $1.25 each is $56.25. For labor, 4 hours at $45 per hour = $180. Total cost is $217+$56.25+$180=$453.25.    No, Gary's estimate is more than $140 too high.        A Fence   The Mazurskys want to build a chain link fence around the backyard (the fence is already shown in the diagram above). The fence would have two gates on either side of the house. They decide to do the work themselves. They need an inline post at least every 8 feet along the fence, a corner post at each corner, and a corner post on each side of the gates. The cost for the materials is shown below. The total cost will include 9.4% sales tax.      Chain-link fence  48-inch wide gate  Inline posts  Corner\/gate posts    $7 per linear foot  $75 each  $12.50 each  $20 each                            Are the gates in the diagram drawn to scale?    How many corner\/gate posts and how many inline posts do they need?    How many feet of fence will they need?    Calculate the cost of the materials required to fence in the backyard, after tax.          No, in the diagram they are too big.    There are four corners, plus 2 posts on each side of the two gates, for a total of 8 corner posts.  The top is 140 feet, and 140\/8 = 17.5, so 17 inline posts will be needed. The right-hand side is 115 feet, and 115\/8 = 14.375, so 14 posts will be needed. The bottom side is 130 feet, and 130\/8 = 16.25, so 16 posts will be needed. The left side above the house is 25-4 = 21 feet, and 21\/8 = 2.625, so 2 posts will be needed. The left side below the house is 40-4=36 feet, and 36\/8 = 4.5, so 4 posts are needed. Altogether, 17+14+16+2+4 = 53 inline posts will be needed.    The top requires 140 feet of fence, the right side 115 feet, the bottom 130 feet. The left side above the house will need 25-4 = 21 feet, and the left side below the house 40-4 = 36 feet. Altogether, 140+115+130+21+36 = 442 feet of fencing.    8 posts at $20 each = $160.  53 posts at $12.50 each is $662.50  442 feet at $7 per foot = $3094  2 gates at $75 each = $150. The total cost is $160 + $662.50 + $3094 + $150 = $4066.50 before tax, and $4066.50 + 0.094(4066.50) = 4448.75 after tax       "

How many corner\/gate posts and how many inline posts do they need?    How many feet of fence will they need?    Calculate the cost of the materials required to fence in the backyard, after tax.          No, in the diagram they are too big.    There are four corners, plus 2 posts on each side of the two gates, for a total of 8 corner posts.  The top is 140 feet, and 140\/8 = 17.5, so 17 inline posts will be needed. The right-hand side is 115 feet, and 115\/8 = 14.375, so 14 posts will be needed. The bottom side is 130 feet, and 130\/8 = 16.25, so 16 posts will be needed. The left side above the house is 25-4 = 21 feet, and 21\/8 = 2.625, so 2 posts will be needed. The left side below the house is 40-4=36 feet, and 36\/8 = 4.5, so 4 posts are needed. Altogether, 17+14+16+2+4 = 53 inline posts will be needed.    The top requires 140 feet of fence, the right side 115 feet, the bottom 130 feet. The left side above the house will need 25-4 = 21 feet, and the left side below the house 40-4 = 36 feet. Altogether, 140+115+130+21+36 = 442 feet of fencing.    8 posts at $20 each = $160.  53 posts at $12.50 each is $662.50  442 feet at $7 per foot = $3094  2 gates at $75 each = $150. The total cost is $160 + $662.50 + $3094 + $150 = $4066.50 before tax, and $4066.50 + 0.094(4066.50) = 4448.75 after tax      "

Link and create verbal, numeric, visual and symbolic representations of the relationship.  Compare proportional relationships represented in different ways, considering units when doing so.     What Information Do You Need?   The World Health Organization (www.who.org) is the part of the United Nations that oversees health issues in the world. The WHO leads numerous studies on tobacco use around the world. In its study on Gender and Tobacco, the organization learned that tobacco use among women is increasing. For example, recent research shows that just as many young girls smoke as young boys. The report is filled with information about percentages of women who smoke, percentages of men who smoke, and the percentage of smokers who start smoking by age 10. The language used to describe this information can be difficult to understand. Pay close attention to the language used to describe a percent at the beginning of this lesson. This will help you to understand new findings in the relationship between tobacco use and gender.  Consider the following two quantities:    Quantity 1 (Q1): The percentage of women who smoke.  Quantity 2 (Q2): The percentage of smokers who are women.    For each quantity, what information would you need to compute these percentages?     For Quantity 1 (Q1): (select all you would need)    Total number of smokers in the population  Total number of women in the population  Total number of women smokers in the population      For Quantity 2 (Q2): (select all you would need)    Total number of smokers in the population  Total number of women in the population  Total number of women smokers in the population         For Quantity 1 (Q1):    Total number of women in the population  Total number of women smokers in the population    For Quantity 2 (Q2):    Total number of smokers in the population  Total number of women smokers in the population        Suppose a study on smoking was conducted at Midland University.

What percentage of smokers at Midland University are women (round to the nearest one percent)?    How many women would need to stop smoking for the percentage of women who smoke to drop below 20%?          There are 18,098 women represented on the survey. Of them, 5,362 smoke, which is 5362\/18098 ~~ .2963 = about 30%    There are 9,934 smokers represented on the survey. Of them, 5,362 are women, which is 5362\/9934 ~~ .5398 = about 54%    20% of 18,098 is 3619.6. 5362 (current number of women smokers) minus 3619.6 (20% of all women on campus) = 1742.4. At least 1743 women need to stop smoking in order for the percentage of women smokers at this campus to drop below 20%.         Suppose a study on smoking was conducted at Northwest College.

Of them, 536 are women, which is 536\/1792 ~~ .2991 = about 30%    The number of men who smoke is greater than the number of men who do not smoke. The smokers must be more than 50% of the total population of men. But the number is not so large that it would be over 70%    There are 3,873 total students represented on the survey.

Based on these data, what percentage of men in China smoke?          3.7% of Chinese women smoke, which means 3.7 out of 100. Since the number of smokers needs to be an integer, you might expect to have about three or four women out of 100 who smoke.    3.7% of Chinese women smoke, which is 3.7 out of 100, or 37 out of 1000    19% of US women smoke, which is 19 out of 100    19% of US women smoke, which is 19 out of 100, or 190 out of 1000    You cannot tell without knowing the number of women in each country.

  "body": " Introduction to Spreadsheets   Introduction to Spreadsheets   Students will be able to:     Perform basic calculations on a spreadsheet    Use cell references and the fill-down feature      A spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, is a very useful tool for doing calculations and making complex tables. You can type in your own custom calculations or use the built-in formulas.  The rectangles within a spreadsheet are called cells spreadsheet cells , and they can be referenced by their column letter and row number. The first cell in the upper left side highlighted below is A1. If we wanted to talk about the third column and the fifth row, that cell would be C5.    A blank spreadsheet with the cell A1 highlighted    A spreadsheet file can contain many sheets. Look along the bottom to see if there is more than one sheet and make sure you are on the right sheet.    A blank spreadsheet showing the sheet tabs at the bottom of the screen.      Basic Calculations  To do a calculation on a spreadsheet, type an equal sign before the operation. This lets the program know that you want it to calculate the result. When you press enter, you will see the result.       To add 3 + 4, enter =3+4     To subtract 100-76, enter =100-76     To multiply 4 times 18, enter =4*18     To divide 0.05 by 12, enter =0.05\/12     To calculate , enter =5^25       A spreadsheet showing the examples entered in the spreadsheet. cell A1 has =3+4, cell A2 has =100-76, cell A3 has =4*18, cell A4 has =0.05\/12 and cell A5 has =5^25.     Note that the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Spreadsheets don't recognize parentheses as indicators of multiplication like calculators do, so even if you have parentheses for the order of operations, the asterisk is also needed.  You can make more complicated mathematical expressions using parentheses and other operations. To edit a cell spreadsheet edit a cell click on the editing box at the top, or double click on the cell to edit it directly.    Your bill at a restaurant is $35.75 and you want to leave an 18% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    To work with a percentage, we need to convert it into a decimal first, and then multiply it by the base amount.  In a spreadsheet we would type =0.18*35.75   and get a result of $6.44, rounded to the nearest cent . You would leave a tip of $6.44.      Cell References  One of the powerful things about spreadsheets is using a cell reference, such as C5 in a calculation. When you use a cell reference spreadsheet cell reference , the values will automatically update if any of the referenced values change.  Let's make a spreadsheet for the percentage tip example above. We calculated an 18% tip on a bill of $35.75. We might want to tip 18% in general, but our bill will change values. We labeled the first column Bill Amount and the second column Tip. The amount of $35.75 is entered in cell A2. Then when we write our formula in B2, we want to calculate 18% of A2. That way if the number in A2 changes, our tip will automatically update.    A spreadsheet showing a formula with a cell reference, =0.18*A2    The formula =0.18*A2 is entered in B2 which gives a result of $6.44 when you hit enter.    The same spreadsheet showing when the input in A1 is changed to $45, the answer to the formula changes to $8.10.    When the bill amount is changed, the tip is recalculated.    Cell Formatting  We can also format cells A1 and B1 to show dollar signs by clicking on the dollar sign in the number formatting menu.    Fill-Down Feature  The fill-down feature spreadsheet fill-down feature is very useful for making tables. This allows us to copy values or formulas to save time. Let's make a tipping reference table with values from $10, to$100, in increments of $10. First, we will enter two values in column A to establish the pattern. Then select those two cells and you will see a small square in the lower right corner. Drag that square down until you get to $100.    A spreadsheet showing the fill-down feature; cells A2 and A3 are highligted for the pattern and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.      This spreadsheet shows the completed bill amount column from $10 to $100 and shows the fill-down feature for the formula; cell B2 has the equation =0.18*A2 and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.    Next, we can drag our formula down and the cell reference will change to each row number automatically.  Here are the formulas with the row numbers updated:    This spreadsheet shows the result of filling down the formula. The cell reference changes for each new row.    Here is our completed table with the calculations:    This spreadsheet shows the calculated values for tips from $10-100.      Formulas  Spreadsheets have many useful built-in formulas. We will introduce some of the financial formulas in this chapter. Here are some of the formulas we will use:    =FV to calculate the future values of an investment     =PV to calculate the deposit needed for a desired future balance     =PMT to calculate a loan or savings plan payment     =EFFECT to calculate the effective rate of an account and compare accounts     In the rest of this chapter we will use spreadsheets and formulas to calculate the future values, interest paid or earned and monthly payments.    Using a Spreadsheet for a Personal Budget   Budget Project   In this lab, you will create a budget spreadsheet to keep track of monthly income, expences, and savings, and you will use several spreadsheet functions and formulas.    Create a new spreadsheet in Goolge Sheets, Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. This lab will refer to functions and formulas in Google sheets.    Gracie wants to save for a summer vacation with her friends. She estimates that her vacation will cost $2000. Can she afford to go? To find out, she decides to buget her income and expenses for the spring semester to determine if she'll have enough money saved in order to go. Set up your spreadsheet so that it matches the picture below.     Fill in the bugdget with the following information  Gracie's first job makes $500 a month.  Gracie only works her second job during March, April, and May. She makes $200 each of those months.  Gracie receives birthday money from some of her relatives in February totally $75.  Gracie pays for $35 of school supplies in January and $15 in March.  Gracie spends $100 a month on groceries.  Gracie spends $10 a month on toiletries (toothpaste, shampoo, etc.)  Gracie spends $25 a month on streaming services.  Gracie spends $70 a month on eating out and getting coffee.  Gracie spends $20 on birthday gifts for her family in the months of January (her mom), March (her brother), and May (her dad).  Gracie spends $45 on gasoline each month because she visits her family many weekends during the school year.      Create formulas for the Total column, the Month Total rows, and the Savings row.    You should end up computing Gracie's total savings as a number less than her goal of $2000. How much money does she save up in this scenario? How much is she short of her goal?    Help Gracie decide what expenses to cut in order to reach her goal. Precisely list everything she should change, and what her new total savings will be after making your suggested changes.    Copy and paste your spreadsheet into the space below.    Use moral, ethical, and\/or biblical reaons to explain why the changes you suggested above were the best choices for Gracie. Feel free to use your imagination to fill in necessary details about her life. Write 1-3 paragraphs.  This question will be graded according to your use of ethical, moral, or Biblical principles in your reasoning, and your use of numbers in your reasoning, such as:    Interpretation: Ability to explain information presented in mathematical forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)  Application \/ Analysis: Ability to make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the limits of this analysis  Communication: Expressing quantitative evidence in support of the argument or purpose of the work (in terms of what evidence is used and how it is formatted, presented, and contextualized)        Exercises   Use a spreadsheet to compute the following questions.

How much would you add to the bill?    =55.75*20% which gives $11.15    You leave a tip for $7.50 for a bill at a restaurant that is $44.50. What percent tip did you leave?    =7.50\/44.50 which gives approximately 0.1685, or approximately 16.85%    In Column A use the fill down feature to build a spreadsheet starting with $5 and ending at $125, in increments of $5. In Column B write a formula with a cell reference to calculate a 15.5% tip on the amount in Column A. Use the fill down feature to complete your table.   See the table below:  Note, the entry in cell B1 is =15%*A1 . (Columns A and B are given dollar formatting)    A portion of a spreadsheet is shown which includes cells A1 through B25, and with a title heading of Table 1. Cell A1 shows $5.00, cell A2 shows $10.00, and so on. The pattern shows that each additional cell under A1 is equal to the cell above it, plus $5.00. This pattern continues down to cell A25, which shows $125.00. Cell B1 shows $0.78, which is 15% of the $5.00 amount shown in cell A1. Cell B2 shows $1.55, which is 15% of the $10.00 amount shown in cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell B25, which shows $19.38, and which is 15% of the $125.00 amount shown in cell A25.      Imagine a certain savings account started out with a balance of $5250.00 on day-one, and today has a current balance of $5780.23     Exactly how much more money does the account have today, compared with day-one?    Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent: By what percentage amount has the account balance grown?    If instead, the bank balance today was exactly double the starting balance, then by what exact percentage amount would the bank balance have grown?    If the bank balance today had instead grown by 15.5% since day-one, then what would be the exact amount of today's balance?          =5780.23-5250 which gives $530.23     =530.23\/5250 which gives approximately 0.100996, or approximately 10.1%    Exactly 200%     =5250*115.5% which gives exactly $6063.75       Imagine that at the start of a certain month, you will make an opening deposit of $500 into a savings account, and you will then leave the account alone (meaning you will make no further deposits or withdrawals). Also, for this account: Every month after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 101% of its previous month's balance.     Use a spreadsheet to enter 500 in cell A1. Using a formula and a cell-reference: Compute in cell A2, the amount in the account after one month has passed. Then using the fill down feature, continue the pattern for another eleven full months (you should end at cell A13). Format all the cells to show dollar signs. What is the amount in the account after one year?    Now continue the pattern in column A of your spreadsheet to extend for a second full year (you should end at cell A25). What is the amount in the account after two years?    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the opening deposit and one year later? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the end of year one, and the end of year two? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    (Challenge) The annual percentage growth that you found in part (d) for the second year, should be identical to the annual percentage growth that you found in part (c) for the first year. Can you mathematically explain why this is true? Do you think this pattern of identical overall annual percentage growth would continue, if you extend the pattern for even more years?         See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 1 year, the account holds $563.41.    See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 2 years, the account holds $634.87.     =A13\/A1 which gives growth     =A25\/A13 which gives growth (same)    Each starting value increases mathematically by a factor of each year, which is approximately 112.6825%. So yes, this pattern must continue indefinitely into future years.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown covering cells A1 through A25, and with a title heading of Table 2. Cell A1 shows $500.00. Cell A2 shows $505.00, which is 101% of cell A1. Cell A3 shows $510.05, which is 101% of cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell A25, which shows $634.87, and which is 101% of cell A24.      Imagine that at the start of a certain year, you will deposit $1000.00 into a savings account, and then you will leave the account alone. Each year after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 103% of its previous year's balance.     After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%) * (103%) . Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.    Now enter the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%)^2 . Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.    Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)    (Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)    (Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?          =1000*103%*103% which gives $1060.90     =1000*(103%)^2 gives the same result of $1060.90, because raising 103% to the second power means the same as multiplying 103% by itself two times.     =1000*(103%)^15 which gives $1557.97 rounded to the nearest cent    Refer to the table at the bottom for part d and part e.  Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.  You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.    Since , the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown, which includes cells A1 through E32, and with a title heading of Table 3. Cell A1 shows a column title of Year, and cells A2 through A32 contain values of 0 through 30, respectively. Cells D1 through D32 are a copy of cells A1 through A32. Cell B1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $1,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell A1. Cell B3 shows $1,030.00, which is 103% of the $1,000 shown in cell B2. Cell B4 shows $1,060.90, which is 103% of the $1,030.00 shown in cell B3. This pattern continues until we get to cell B32, which shows $2,427.26, and which is 103% of the $2,356.57 amount shown in cell B31. Cell E1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $5,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell D1. Cell E3 shows $5,150.00, which is 103% of the $5,000 shown in cell E2. Cell E4 shows $5,304.50, which is 103% of the $5,150.00 shown in cell E3. This pattern continues until we get to cell E32, which shows $12,136.31, and which is 103% of the $11,782.83 amount shown in cell E31.      "

Create a new spreadsheet in Goolge Sheets, Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. This lab will refer to functions and formulas in Google sheets.    Gracie wants to save for a summer vacation with her friends. She estimates that her vacation will cost $2000. Can she afford to go? To find out, she decides to buget her income and expenses for the spring semester to determine if she'll have enough money saved in order to go. Set up your spreadsheet so that it matches the picture below.     Fill in the bugdget with the following information  Gracie's first job makes $500 a month.  Gracie only works her second job during March, April, and May. She makes $200 each of those months.  Gracie receives birthday money from some of her relatives in February totally $75.  Gracie pays for $35 of school supplies in January and $15 in March.  Gracie spends $100 a month on groceries.  Gracie spends $10 a month on toiletries (toothpaste, shampoo, etc.)  Gracie spends $25 a month on streaming services.  Gracie spends $70 a month on eating out and getting coffee.  Gracie spends $20 on birthday gifts for her family in the months of January (her mom), March (her brother), and May (her dad).  Gracie spends $45 on gasoline each month because she visits her family many weekends during the school year.      Create formulas for the Total column, the Month Total rows, and the Savings row.    You should end up computing Gracie's total savings as a number less than her goal of $2000. How much money does she save up in this scenario? How much is she short of her goal?    Help Gracie decide what expenses to cut in order to reach her goal. Precisely list everything she should change, and what her new total savings will be after making your suggested changes.    Copy and paste your spreadsheet into the space below.    Use moral, ethical, and\/or biblical reaons to explain why the changes you suggested above were the best choices for Gracie. Feel free to use your imagination to fill in necessary details about her life. Write 1-3 paragraphs.  This question will be graded according to your use of ethical, moral, or Biblical principles in your reasoning, and your use of numbers in your reasoning, such as:    Interpretation: Ability to explain information presented in mathematical forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words)  Application \/ Analysis: Ability to make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the limits of this analysis  Communication: Expressing quantitative evidence in support of the argument or purpose of the work (in terms of what evidence is used and how it is formatted, presented, and contextualized)     "

Be sure to check with your instructor for which method to use.   Working with money is a very important skill for everyday life. While balancing a checkbook or calculating our monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving money, planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics and tools. In this section we will calculate and compare simple and compound interest.   Personal Finance Reflections   In this chapter we'll discuss finances, so this preview activity will include three reflection questions.    Do you use a budget? Why or why not?    List some places in your finances where you might be able to save a few dollars or more per week or per month.    Consider this Bible passage below   Proverbs 6:1-5  New International Readers Version (NIRV)   My son, don't promise to pay for what your neighbor owes.  Don't agree to pay a stranger's bill.  Don't be trapped by what you have said.  Don't be caught by the words of your mouth.  Instead, my son, do something to free yourself.  Don't fall into your neighbor's hands.  Go until you can't go anymore.  Don't let your neighbor rest.  Don't let your eyes go to sleep.  Don't let your eyelids close.  As a deer frees itself from a hunter, free yourself.  As a bird frees itself from a trapper, free yourself.    How does this passage relate to personal finance? Is there any way for you to apply this to your own life?       Compound Interest      What is 5% of $1000?    Add your answer to the original $1000    Compute . Is your answer the same as ?    Compute 5% of your answer from     Add your answers from and     Compute . Does your answer match ?          Simple Interest  Calculating interest starts with the principal principle , P , or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the present value present value . This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The interest rate interest rate , I , in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.  For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is very important to remember to change the interest rate , r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left.     The total amount you would repay is called the future value future value and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.     Here are the formulas to represent the calculations we just did.   Simple One-time Interest            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount or present value present value      is the interest rate interest rate in decimal form     is the end amount: principal plus interest. This is also called the future value future value         A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% simple interest. How much interest will you earn?     , the principal or present value   , 3% rate  Using the formula,     To calculate this in a spreadsheet, you would enter =300*0.03 and get a result of $9. You will earn $9 in interest when your friend pays you back.    One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. Bonds are an example of this type of investment. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.    Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?    Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:     When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:     Using a spreadsheet, you would enter =1000+1000*0.05 and get a result of $1,250. The future value of the bond is $1,250.    We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.   Simple Interest over Time            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount, or present value     is the interest rate in decimal form     is time, where the increment of time (years, months, etc.) matches the time period for the interest rate     is the end amount, principal plus interest, or future value        APR – Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.  Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is half a percent per month.     A 4% annual rate paid quarterly, would be divided by 4 to get 1% per quarter.     Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.    Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?     , the principal   , interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.   , 4 years compounded twice a year gives half-years     You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is     We could also use a spreadsheet to do this calculation and enter:   =1000+1000*(0.04\/2)*(4*2)   which also gives $1,160. The future value of the bond is $1,160. Remember that spreadsheets don't interpret parentheses as multiplication. We need the asterisks as well as the parentheses.      Compound Interest  In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding compound interest . We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn per month.  In the first month,     In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,     Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.  Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:     Month  Starting balance  Interest earned  Ending Balance    1  1000.00  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57    6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.64  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.56  1030.42     To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:  Initial Amount:               Observing a pattern, we could conclude     Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write   Compound Interest        A  is the future value balance in the account after years    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years      If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done weekly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.    The Future Value Spreadsheet Formula  The compound interest formula is built into spreadsheets and is called the future value formula.   Future Value Spreadsheet Formula   =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,       We will use the payment amount in a future section, for now that will be 0. There is also an optional input at the end to specify making payments at the beginning or end of the period, but we will not use it in this book.  Now let's look at an example and calculate the compound interest using the spreadsheet and the mathematical formula.    A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?     , the initial deposit   , 6% annual rate   , 12 months in 1 year   , since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years  To use a spreadsheet, we will use the formula like this =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)    =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)   and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. A negative number may be denoted with a negative sign or with the color red or parentheses. The signs may be used in accounting, but we will ignore them in this book.  To use a formula, we are looking for the future value, so we use the formula solved for A:     To use a calculator, you would enter the formulas including parentheses around any inside operations. You would enter   3000(1+(0.06\/12))^(12*20)=9930.61       If you invest $500 at 6% interest, calculate the balance after 5 years for each compounding interval. Write the formula used and inputs in proper syntax.     Simple Interest    Compounded Yearly    Compounded Quarterly    Compounded Monthly    Compounded Daily (365)    Compounded Continuously         Comparing Simple and Compound Interest  Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.       Year  Simple Interest ($15 per month)  Compound Interest (6% compounded monthly or 0.5% each month    0  $3000  $3000    5  $3900  $4046.55    10  $4800  $5458.19    15  $5700  $7362.28    20  $6600  $9930.61    25  $7500  $13394.91    30  $8400  $18067.73    35  $9300  $24370.65      A coordinate graph with years on the x-axis and account balance on the y-axis. The simple interest increases in a straight line; the compound interest curves up faster because it is an exponential function.      Finding the Principal, or Present Value  When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for P . It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by P . There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.    The Present Value Spreadsheet Formula  The present value spreadsheet formula will calculate how much you need to deposit in the present to get a specified future value.   Present Value Spreadsheet Formula   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     future value  is the amount desired in the future,         You know that you will need $40,000 for your child's education in 18 years. If your account earns 4% APR compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your goal?    We are looking for what we need to deposit now so we will use the present value formula. We type the formula and inputs the same way we used the future value formula.   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PV(0.04\/4, 4*18, 0, 40000)   which gives a value of $19,539.84. You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now and keep the same interest rate to have $40,000 in 18 years.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that we cannot enter commas in numbers in a spreadsheet. Commas are used to separate the input values, so we would not get the same answer if we put in $40,000 for an input.  To use the mathematical formula, we use the one that is solved for P .   , 4% APR   , 4 quarters in 1 year   , since we know the balance in 18 years   , the amount we have in 18 years  In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for P.     You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.      Continuously Compounded Interest  In many bank accounts your interest is compounded continuously, or at each moment in time. The number of times per year, n, is infinite. As n approaches infinity the compound interest formula changes to the continuously compounded interest formula.   Continuously Compounded Interest        A  is the future value or desired balance in the account    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    t  is the number of years    e  is an irrational number that is approximately 2.718281828… Find on your calculator to use this formula     To calculate this on a spreadsheet we use the =EXP function. The spreadsheet formulas are   =Principal*EXP(r*t) or =A\/EXP(r*t)      You deposit $4000 in an account that earns 2.75% APR compounded continuously. How much will you have after 7 years? How much interest did you earn? What percentage of the final balance is interest?      To use a spreadsheet, we look at the formula solved for A, the future value. We enter   =4000*EXP(0.0275*7)   and get a result of $4849.11.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:      , amount invested   , interest rate   , number of years     After 7 years your account would be worth $4,849.11. Next, we will calculate the amount of interest earned and the percentage.      Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage  In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.   Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.     The spreadsheet calculation is   =4849.11-4000   which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.  To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.     The spreadsheet calculation is the same:   =849.11\/4849.11   which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.     Effective Rate  If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called =EFFECT which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.   Effective Rate Formula   =EFFECT(stated rate, number of compounding periods)      stated rate  is the interest rate given (APR)    number of compounding periods  is the number of times the account is compounded per year,         You are comparing an account that pays 5.25% APR compounded monthly, with an account that pays 5% APR compounded daily. Which account will earn you more interest?    It is hard to tell whether the higher interest rate will be better or the higher compounding rate in this case. We will find the effective rate of both accounts.  For the 5.25% APR account compounded monthly:     =EFFECT(0.0525,12)   which gives 0.05378 or 5.38%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05,365)   which gives 0.05127 or 5.13%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now we can compare the effective rates of 5.38% and 5.13% and see that the account with the higher interest rate will earn more interest in this case. This is not always true, so we will show another example.      Find the effective rates to compare an account that earns 6% APR compounded quarterly with an account that earns 5.975% APR compounded daily. Which one would you choose?    Using the effective rate formula for each, we have:  For the 6% APR account compounded quarterly:     =EFFECT(0.06,4)   which gives 0.06136 or 6.14%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5.975% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05975,365)   which gives 0.06157 or 6.16%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The account that was compounded more often has a slightly higher rate in this case.      Exercises   A friend lends you $200 for a week, which you agree to repay with 5% one-time interest. How much will you have to repay?      You will have to repay $210.    You loan your friend $100. They agree to pay an annual interest rate of 3%, simple interest. Six months later they repay that loan.   How much did they pay you?    How much was interest?                    They paid $101.50 total, $1.50 was interest.    Consider a simple interest loan of $200 with an annual interest rate of 6%. If that loan is paid off 1 year and 3 months later, how much was repaid?      $215 was repaid.    You deposit $1,000 in an account that earns simple interest. The annual interest rate is 2.5%.     How much interest will you earn in 5 years?    How much will you have in the account in 5 years?                  The interest earned was $125. This brings the account balance to $1,125.    Consider an investment of $20000 with an annual interest rate of 5%.   If that investment is earning simple interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?    If that investment is getting annually compounding interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?                    The simple interest account would be worth $30,000 and the account that was compounding would be worth $32,577.89 in ten years.    Nico invests $4,500 into an account that has an annual interest rate of 8.5%. The interest is compounding monthly. Twenty years later what is the account balance?      The account balance is $24,485.59 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.085\/12,12*20,0,4500)     How much will $1,000 deposited in an account earning 7% APR compounded weekly be worth in 20 years?      The account balance is $4,051.38 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.07\/52,52*20,0,1000)     Suppose you obtain a $3,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) with a 3% APR, paid quarterly, with maturity in 5 years.     What is the future value of the CD in 5 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            The future value is $3,483.55.  Or, =FV(0.03\/4,4*5,0,3000)        The interest earned is $483.54.       13.88% of the balance is interest.       You deposit $300 in an account earning 5% APR compounded annually. How much will you have in the account in 10 years?     How much will you have in the account in 10 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            There will be $488.67 in the account in 10 years.  Or, =FV(0.05\/1,1*10,0,300)        $188.67 of the balance will be interest.       The interest makes up 38.61% of the balance.       You deposit $2,000 in an account earning 3% APR compounded monthly.     How much will you have in the account in 20 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?    What percent of the balance is the principal?            The account will have $3,641.51 in 20 years  Or, =FV(0.03\/12,12*20,0,2000)        The interest will be $1641.51.       The interest is 45.08% of the balance.       The principal is 54.92% of the balance.       You deposit $10,000 in an account earning 4% APR compounded weekly.     How much will you have in the account in 25 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?    What percent of the balance is the principal?            The balance is $27,172.37.  Or, =FV(0.04\/52,52*25,0,10000)        The interest is $17,172.37.       The percent that is interest is 63.2%.       The percentage that is the principal is 36.2%.       How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $6,000 in the account in 8 years? Assume the account earns 6% APR compounded monthly.      The principal required would be $3717.14  Or, =PV(0.06\/12,12*8,0,6000)     How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $20,000 in the account in 4 years?

Consider this Bible passage below   Proverbs 6:1-5  New International Readers Version (NIRV)   My son, don't promise to pay for what your neighbor owes.  Don't agree to pay a stranger's bill.  Don't be trapped by what you have said.  Don't be caught by the words of your mouth.  Instead, my son, do something to free yourself.  Don't fall into your neighbor's hands.  Go until you can't go anymore.  Don't let your neighbor rest.  Don't let your eyes go to sleep.  Don't let your eyelids close.  As a deer frees itself from a hunter, free yourself.  As a bird frees itself from a trapper, free yourself.    How does this passage relate to personal finance? Is there any way for you to apply this to your own life?     "

Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children.  Just like the last section, we will emphasize spreadsheets but calculate each example with the formulas as well. Check with your instructor for which way you should do your problems.    Warmup    Match the types of graphs with the types of interest below.        Simple Interest    Compound Interest          Simple Interest is linear.    Compound Interest is exponential.

This time for regular payments we will use the field for payment amount. If we are not making an initial deposit, the present value will be zero.  Here is the future value formula again:   Future Value Spreadsheet Formula   =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments    present value  is the initial principal. If none, enter       The mathematical formulas are shown below. If you want to know how we got the formula, it is derived at the end of the chapter.   Savings Plan Formulas        A  is the balance in the account after n years (future value)    d  is the regular deposit (or payment amount each month, quarter, year, etc.)    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years      If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated, assume there are the same number of compounds in a year as there are deposits made in a year.  If you make your deposits every year, use yearly compounding, .  If you make your deposits every quarter, use quarterly compounding, .  If you make your deposits every month, use monthly compounding, , etc.  To see how both of these methods work, let's look at an example.    A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR, how much will you have in the account after 20 years? How much will you have earned in interest? What percentage of the balance is interest?    To use a spreadsheet, we will use =FV because we want to know the balance in the future. We enter 100 for the payment amount and 0 for the present value:     =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 100, 0)   which gives a result of $46,204.09.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Remember that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. For our purposes we will ignore the signs. To use the formula, we use the one solved for A , since we want to know the final amount.   , the monthly deposit   , 6% annual rate   , since we're doing monthly deposits, we'll compound monthly   , we want the amount after 20 years  Putting this into the equation we have:     With U.S. dollars we round to the nearest cent. The account will grow to $46,204.09 after 20 years.  To find the amount of interest earned , calculate the total of all your deposits.     The difference between the total amount and the deposits is the interest earned.     The total amount of interest you earned was $22,204.09.  To find the percentage of the balance that is interest we will divide the interest by the total balance.     or 48.1%. After 20 years 48.1% of the balance is from interest.    Now here's an example with an initial deposit and monthly deposits. We can do this with the spreadsheet formula.    You want to jumpstart your saving by depositing $1500 from your tax return and then deposit $150 every month into an account that earns 5.5% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 30 years?    Using the spreadsheet formula, we can enter an initial deposit and a monthly payment. We enter     =FV(0.055\/12, 12*30, 150,1500)   and get a result of $144,822.87.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.        Finding Payment Amounts Usings Spreadsheets and Formulas  Another important thing we can calculate is how much we need to save in each period to have a specified amount in the future. Say you want to achieve a certain amount for retirement or for your kids' college.  The mathematical formula for this is the one solved for d, the payment amount, above. There is a new spreadsheet formula to calculate payments, =PMT, that we will introduce now.   Payment Spreadsheet Formula   =PMT(rate per period, number of periods, present value, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,     future value  is the amount you want in the future,       Here is an example of a retirement goal calculated with a spreadsheet and the formula.    You want to have half a million dollars in your account when you retire in 30 years. Your retirement account earns 8% APR. How much do you need to deposit each month to meet your retirement goal?    To calculate this with a spreadsheet, we will use the =PMT function and enter 0 for the present value and $500,000 for the future value. We cannot enter commas within the numbers however, because spreadsheets use commas to separate the inputs. We enter:     =PMT(0.08\/12, 12*30, 0, 500000)   and get a result of $335.49.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To see how this works with the formulas, we use the one solved for d , the regular deposit amount.   , 8% annual rate   , since we're depositing monthly   , 30 years   , the amount we want to have in 30 years      So, you would need to deposit $335.49 each month to have $500,000 in 30 years if your account earns 8% interest.      Use a spreadsheet to work on these problems. Write down the syntax to show your work. Answer each question in a complete sentence.  Jackie is 34 years old. She would like to have one million dollars in her retirement account when she is 65 years old.     How much would she need to deposit every month into an account with an APR of 7.25%, compounded monthly, to achieve her goal?    If Jackie had started the account at age 21 (same APR), how much would she need to deposit every month to achieve her goal?    If Jackie had started the account at age 21 (same APR) and deposited the amount calculated in Exercise 1 every month, what would the balance be when she retired at age 65?    How much would Jackie need to deposit as a lump sum at age 21 with the same APR (without making another payment) to have a million dollars at age 65?          =PMT(0.0725\/12, (65-34)*12, 0, 1000000)  = $719.22  She would need to deposit $719.22 each month to have a million dollars when she retires.     =PMT(0.0725\/12, (65-21)*12, 0, 1000000)   = $262.04  She would need to deposit $262.04 each month to have a million dollars when she retires.     =FV(0.0725\/12, (65-21)*12, 719.22)   = $2,744,713.35  She would have over $2.7 million dollars when she retired.     =PV(0.0725\/12, (65-21)*12, 0, 1000000)   = $41,568.93  She would need to deposit $41,568.93 at age 21 to have a million dollars when she retires.        A note about rounding  If you are using the formulas and round during intermediate steps you will probably have some roundoff error. For this reason, we enter the whole expression into the calculator and do not show the intermediate steps.   One of the challenges in this chapter is choosing the correct formula or spreadsheet function. Read this next example and see if you can determine which formula to use.    A more conservative investment account pays 3% APR. If you deposit $5 a day into this account, how much will you have after 10 years? What amount and percentage are from interest?    In this example we are given the regular deposit amount and we are looking for the future value. In a spreadsheet we use the =FV function and enter:     =FV(0.03\/365, 365*10, 5,0)   which gives a result of $21,282.07.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use a mathematical formula, we choose the one solved for A :   , the daily deposit   , 3% annual rate   , since we're doing daily deposits, we'll compound daily   , we want the amount after 10 years     To find the amount of interest, we will calculate how much was deposited in the account. Since you put in $5 a day for 10 years we get   .  The interest earned is .  To find the percentage we divide by the total balance to get or 14.25%.  After 10 years, about 14.25% of the account is interest.      Comparing Lump Sum and Regular Savings Payments  Now let's compare two scenarios to do some multistep problems and get a sense for the value of compounding over time.    Scenario 1: Suppose you invest $200 a month for 15 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. After 15 years, you leave the money, without making additional deposits, in the account for another 20 years. How much will you have in the end?  Scenario 2: Suppose instead you didn't invest anything for the first 15 years, then deposited $200 a month for 20 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the end?    Before we calculate the balance for both scenarios, which one do you think will have a higher balance at the end?  For scenario 1, there are two steps involved. The first part is the monthly payments for 15 years. To calculate this with a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*15, 200,0)   which gives $82,894.07.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now you will stop making payments and let the money sit and earn interest for 20 more years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 0, 82894.07)   which gives $607,453.85.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The process is similar with the formulas. For the first step we have:     And for the second step we use the compound interest formula from .     Now for Scenario 2: Since we are not investing anything for the first 15 years there is nothing to calculate. This is a one-step problem. We will find the future value with the monthly payments of $200 for 20 years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 200,0)   which gives $151,873.77.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check that with the formula we have:     Were you surprised by these numbers? You would put in less money in scenario 1 and end up with four times as much. The key to compounding interest is to start early. If you remember the graph of compound interest in , we can see that as time goes on, the balance increases exponentially.     Sal, Cal, and Val   Sal, Cal and Val are triplets.   Sal gets a paper route at age 14 and decides to invest $150 each month in a mutual fund which averages a 10% annual return. Sal only makes deposits for 5 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.    Cal is impressed by Sal's bank account, and gets a job in college at age 19 and dutifully makes deposits of $150 each month into the same mutual fund for 9 years and then leaves the balance to compound until retirement at age 65.    Val partied a lot growing up, but then gets a good job at the age of 27 and diligently makes deposits of $150 each month all the way to retirement at the age of 65.     Answer the following questions:     How much money did each brother invest?    How much does each brother have saved for retirement at age 65?    Put the interest rate of 10% into a cell in your spreadsheet, then redo your formulas for so that they reference this cell. Try changing the interest rate until Sal and Cal end up with the same amount at age 65. What is this interest rate?    What interest rate causes Cal and Val to end up with the same amount at age 65?         Deriving the Savings Plan Formula (Optional)  If you are interested in where the savings plan formula came from, we will explain it here. A savings plan with regular payments can be described recursively. Recall that basic compound interest follows from the relationship for each compound period.     For a savings plan, we need to add a deposit, d, to the account with each compounding period:     Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working in general.  Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% APR. We assume that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated otherwise.  In this example:   , 6% APR   , 12 compounds\/deposits per year   , our deposit per month  Writing out the recursive equation gives where A is exchanged with where m is the number of compounding periods.     Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:              Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we'd have saved:     In other words, after months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for months. The second deposit will have earned interest for months. Last month's deposit would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have earned no interest yet.  This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though – it doesn't make calculating the ending balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005:     Distributing on the right side of the equation gives     Now we'll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side        Almost all the terms cancel on the right side when we subtract, leaving     Solving for         Replacing with (Future Value), months with , where is measured in years, gives     Recall was and 100 was the deposit . The value 12 as , the number of deposits each year. Generalizing this result, we get the savings plan formula solved for . The second formula uses algebra to rearrange the formula to be solved for .

Scenario 2: Suppose instead you didn't invest anything for the first 15 years, then deposited $200 a month for 20 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the end?    Before we calculate the balance for both scenarios, which one do you think will have a higher balance at the end?  For scenario 1, there are two steps involved. The first part is the monthly payments for 15 years. To calculate this with a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*15, 200,0)   which gives $82,894.07.

Now for Scenario 2: Since we are not investing anything for the first 15 years there is nothing to calculate. This is a one-step problem. We will find the future value with the monthly payments of $200 for 20 years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 200,0)   which gives $151,873.77.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check that with the formula we have:     Were you surprised by these numbers? You would put in less money in scenario 1 and end up with four times as much. The key to compounding interest is to start early. If you remember the graph of compound interest in , we can see that as time goes on, the balance increases exponentially.   "

  "body": " Loan Payments   Loan Payments   Students will be able to:     Use a spreadsheet and\/or formula to calculate the payment amount for student loans, car loans, paying off credit cards and mortgage loans    Calculate the total paid over the life of a loan, amount of interest paid, and the percentage of the total amount paid in interest    Determine when to use each formula in the financial math chapter      In the last section, you learned about savings plans. In this section, you will learn about conventional loans (also called amortized loans or installment loans). Examples include student loans, car loans and home mortgages. These techniques do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front. In this section we will also briefly cover credit cards. There is a more thorough chapter on credit cards available as an optional chapter.     Installment Loans  Installment loans are also called amortized loans . They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the principal (amount owed) and towards the interest will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.    A graph that shows how most of the payment goes to interest at the beginning of the loan and that decreases over time until the end of the loan when most of the payment goes toward the principal.    This is a graph of the interest and principal paid on a loan of $34,000 at 10% APR. Each year $5391.72 was paid in total. In the first year, $3,3305.92 was applied to the interest and $2085.80 was applied to the principal. In the last year of the loan, only $281.04 was applied to the interest and $5,110.68 was applied to the principal. Over 5 years, a total of $53,917.2 was paid for a loan of $34,000.    Loan Formulas  In a savings plan, you start with nothing, put money into an account once or on a regular basis, and have a larger balance at the end. Loans work in reverse. You start with a balance owed, make payments and the future value is zero when the loan is paid off.  We will continue to use the same spreadsheet formulas. The ones that are most useful for loans are =PV and =PMT . We will look at how the inputs change for a loan.   Spreadsheet Formulas   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PMT(rate per period, number of periods, present value, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments,     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,     future value  is the amount you want in the future, 0 for a loan      These two formulas correspond to the formulas below. The formula for loans is derived in a similar way that we did for savings plans, but notice they have negative exponents. The details are omitted here.   Loan Formulas         is the balance in the account at the beginning (the principal, or amount of the loan).     is your loan payment (your monthly payment, annual payment, etc.)     is the annual interest rate in decimal form     is the number of compounding periods in one year     is the length of the loan, in years     Like before, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by how often you make payments    Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much will her monthly car payment be for each loan and how do these loans compare to each other.   To use a spreadsheet, we use the =PMT formula. For a loan, the loan amount is the present value and the future value is 0, indicating that the loan will be paid off. Teresa is making a down payment, so we also need to subtract that from the cost of the car to find the loan amount:     Her loan amount is $12,000. For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.0275\/12, 12*3, 12000, 0)   and get a result of $347.65.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the formula, we use the one solved for :   , for 2.75% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 3 years   , since she can pay $3,000 of the $15,000     Teresa's car payment would be $347.65.  Now for the 5-year loan at 4% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.04\/12, 12*5, 12000, 0)   and we get $221.00.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , for 4% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 5 years   , the loan amount     Now let's compare the loans by finding out how much Teresa would pay in interest for each loan.    For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $515.40.    For the 5-year loan at 4% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $1,260.00.    There are two main differences between these two loans: the monthly payments and the total paid over the life of the loans. The first loan has a higher monthly payment by $126.65 per month. However, she would pay $744.60 less in interest.         Sam has a student loan of $30,000 at a fixed APR of 4.45%. If he wants to pay it off in 15 years, how much would he pay per month?    How much would Sam pay in total?    What percentage of the total was paid toward the loan amount of $30,000 and what percentage was paid toward interest?           =PMT(0.0445\/12, 15*12, 30000, 0)   = $228.73  They would need to pay $228.73 per month for 15 years.     =$228.73*15*12   = $41,171.40  They would pay a total of $41,171.40 for the loan.     Percentage toward the principal:   =$30,000\/41,171.40   ≈73%  About 73% of the total was paid toward the principal. That means about 27% was paid in interest.        In addition to loan payments, we can calculate the amount of loan we can afford given a monthly payment. Let’s look at that in the next example.    You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% APR for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?    To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PV formula because we want to know the present value, which is the value of the loan right now. We enter    =PV(0.03\/12, 12*5, 200,0) which gives $11,130.47.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use a formula, we are looking for , the starting amount of the loan.   , the monthly loan payment   , 3% annual rate   , since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly   , since we’re making monthly payments for 5 years     You can afford a maximum loan of $11,130.47. If you have a down payment you can add that to get the value of the car you can buy. If there are any closing costs for the loan you also need to take that into consideration.  To find the amount of interest you will pay for this loan, calculate the total of all your payments.     Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.     In this case, you would be paying $869.53 in interest.    So far, we have looked at car loans. Student loans and home mortgages are calculated in the same way. Here is an example of a mortgage payment.    You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%, and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be? What percentage of your total payments will go towards interest?    To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PMT formula because we want to know the payment amount. The amount of the loan is the present value and to pay off the loan the future value is 0. We enter    =PMT(0.06\/12, 12*30, 140000,0) which gives us $839.37.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , 6% annual rate   , since we’re paying monthly   , 30 years   , the starting loan amount  In this case, we’re going to use the equation that is solved for .     You would make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years. To find out what percentage of the total will go towards interest, we need to total up all of the payments.     Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.     In this case, you would be paying $162,173.20 in interest over the life of the loan. To find the percentage, we divide the interest by the total amount paid.     About 53.7% of the total is being paid towards interest.         You want to buy a $350,000 home. You plan to put 10% down and take out a 30-year fixed mortgage on the rest. What will the loan amount be?    What will your monthly payment be on your home mortgage if the interest rate is 4.5%?    If you make all the payments on your home mortgage for 30 years, how much would you have paid for the house in total?    In above, what number would you get if you switch the 0 and the 315,000? Why are the answers so different? Explain the difference between these two scenarios.          Amount of down payment: 0.10(350,000) = $35,000  Loan amount = $350,000 – $35,000 = $315,000  The loan amount is $315,000.     =PMT(0.045\/12, 30*12, 315000, 0)   = $1,596.06  My monthly mortgage payment would be $1,596.06.    =$1,596.06*30*12  = $574,581.14  If I owned the house for 30 years I would pay $574,581.14.    =PMT(0.045\/12, 30*12, 0, 315000)  = $414.81  In Exercise 9, we are making loan payments that include interest in addition to the principal of $315,000. The present value is $315,000 and the future value is $0.  This is different because we switched the present value to $0 and the future value to $315,000. In this case we would be depositing $414.81 per month to save up to $315,000. Interest is working with us instead of against us.         Remaining Loan Balance  With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you will have to pay from the sale.  To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to calculate the payment amount, if we don’t already know it. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.  To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think how much loan will these loan payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?     If a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6% APR has payments of $1,000 a month, what will the loan balance be in 5 years?    To determine this, we need to think backwards. We are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 per month in the remaining 25 years. In other words, we’re looking for when:   , for the monthly loan payment   , for 6% annual rate   , since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly   , since we’d be making monthly payments for 25 more years  To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PV formula because we want to know what the present value would be at the time you want to sell in 5 years. We enter:    =PV(0.06\/12, 12*25, 1000,0) which gives us $155,206.86.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check this with the formula we have:     The loan balance with 25 years remaining on the loan will be $155,206.86    Sometimes answering remaining balance questions requires two steps, both of which we have done in this section:   Calculate the monthly payment on the loan    Calculate the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan       Credit Cards  Credit cards are useful to many people. They can be used to build a credit score, as a short-term loan and as an alternative to physical cash. It is highly advisable to fully pay off a credit card each month because the interest rates are much higher than the conventional installment loans we discussed earlier. There can also be many expensive fees applied when carrying a balance. Because of these higher rates, it can be very easy to get into a lot of debt quickly.  Credit cards are a common source of loan money, and therefore a common source of debt which must be repaid. There are much fewer and lower barriers to obtaining and using a credit card than there are to obtaining, for example, a mortgage. As such, there are some drawbacks both in terms of typically higher interest rates, as well as some structural differences.    Bilqis gets a credit card, with 17.99% APR compounding daily. She uses the card to buy a $900 plane ticket. She does not make any payments during the interest-free grace period. Her first payment is due 35 days after the grace period ended. Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger. What is her outstanding balance? What is her minimum payment? If she pays the minimum payment what will her new balance be?    First we will see what she owes with the 17.99% APR using the compound interest formula for 35 days:     The spreadsheet formula for this computation is =FV(0.1799\/365,35,0,900)   With interest, Bilqis now owes $915.66.  Now we will find one percent of the new balance which is .  $25 is larger than $9.16, so her first payment must be at least $25. If she makes the minimum payment we can subtract to find her new balance:   .  Her new balance will be $890.66.        In this activity you will get a chance to let a computer do most of the math for you. It will be your job to interpret what is going on.  In this figure below, we have sliders to change the original principle of the loan P , the annual percentage rate r , the number of years of the loan Y , and the property tax p_tax . The blue horizontal line is the amount of each monthly payment needed. The red line is the amount of each of those payments going toward interest. Thus, the blue area is the total payments towards principle, and the red area is the total payments towards interest. The orange area represents escrow payments for property taxes and insurance.    If the embedded Desmos page above is too small, you can go to the Desmos page .    Set P equal to $130,000. What number does the area of the blue region correspond to? The area of the blue region corresponds to P , the principle of the loan, or $130,000. (2 points)  Try moving the r and Y sliders around. Does the area of the blue region tend to stay the same, get larger, or get smaller as you make these changes? The area of the blue region stays the same. (2 points)  Given what you know about how loans work, why would this be the case? For their explanation, mark correct if you can tell that they know that this is because the area of the blue region corresponds to the original principle. (2 points)  Suppose you have a budget for $700 a month for a home. Also suppose that you can get an interest rate of 4%, and that you are looking for a 30 year loan. Move the Principle P around to find the maximum house price you can afford. What is it? For this question, you will get full credit as long as you are close enough. In order to get full credit, you need to be within $1,000 of the correct answer. Make sure that you factor in that you will have to make escrow payments. Answer should be $120,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by, unless their answer is about $111,000, in which case take off 1 point becaused that means they were confused by escrow payments.  In the situation from the last part, what percentage of your money goes towards interest over the life of the loan? The amount of money going toward interest is 41.77% (2 point). It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or their number is close enough.  Use the same information from part , but change the length of the loan to 15 years. Now what is the maximum house price you can afford? What now is the percentage of your money going towards interest?   Answer should be $81,000 or $82,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by.  The amount of money going toward interest is 24.80% (2 points). It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or are close enough.    Given your answer to the task above, how would you explain to someone that a 15-year loan has less than twice the monthly payments of a 30 year loan? (6 points) Give at least 3 points for an answer that is coherent. Give full credit for an explanation that basically says that paying off the loan faster means that less money goes toward interest.  Keeping everything else constant, change the annual percentage rate r . Explain how a rising interest rate could be considered to make all home buyers a little poorer. (6 points) Give at least 3 points for an answer that is coherent. Give full credit for an explanation that basically says anything similar to, Rising interest rates cause mortgages to be more expensive, thus causing homes to be more expensive.   Imagine that you have $4,000 in credit card debt, and you'd like to pay it off in 10 years. Your credit card company charges 20% on your debt. How much per month will you have to pay? (For this problem and problem 7 ignore the escrow payments). $77.30 (3 points) Give full credit if they are within $5.  Given the credit card situation from the last part, how much will you have to pay if you try to pay it off in 5 years? $105.98 (3 points) Give full credit if they are within $6.  Given your answer to the last two parts, explain to your friend why it is important to pay credit card debt off as soon as possible. (6 points) Give at least 3 points for anything coherent. Give full credit for an explanation that mentions the relatively small increase in monthly payments to cut the length of the loan in half.

After practicing with the exercises from this section, you can test yourself on which formula to use with exercises 14-21.    Exercises   You can afford a $700 per month mortgage payment. You’ve found a 30-year loan at 5.5% APR.     How big of a loan can you afford?    How much total money will you pay the loan company?    How much of that money is interest?          , which gives   or =PV(5.5%\/12,12*30,-700) [Note 700 is entered as negative, to signify a payment]     dollars, or $252,000.00 in total payments to the loan company    Interest will be the difference between the total payments, and the amount borrowed. So the interest on this loan is .       Marie can afford a $250 per month car payment. She’s found a 5-year loan at 7% APR.     How expensive of a car can she afford?    How much total money will she pay the loan company?    How much of that money is interest?          , which gives   or =PV(7%\/12,12*5,-250)      dollars, or $15,000.00 in total payments to the loan company.    Interest will be the difference between the total payments, and the amount borrowed. So the interest on this loan is .       You want to buy a $25,000 car. The company is offering an interest rate of 2% APR for 48 months (4 years). What will your monthly payments be?    , which gives   or =PMT(2%\/12,48,25000)     You decide to finance a $12,000 car at 3% APR compounded monthly for 4 years. What will your monthly payments be? How much interest will you pay over the life of the loan?    , which gives   or =PMT(3%\/12,48,12000)   The interest will be the total amount paid, minus the amount of the loan. So the interest here is     You want to buy a $200,000 home. You plan to pay 10% as a down payment and take out a 30-year loan for the rest.     How much is the loan amount going to be?    What will your monthly payments be if the interest rate is 5%?    What will your monthly payments be if the interest rate is 6%?         The loan amount will be 90% of $200,000.00      , which gives   or =PMT(5%\/12,12*30,180000)      , which gives   or =PMT(6%\/12,12*30,180000)        Lynn bought a $300,000 house, paying 10% down, and financing the rest at 6.5% APR for 30 years.     Find her monthly payments.    How much interest will she pay over the life of the loan?    What percentage of her total payment was interest?          , which gives   or =PMT(6.5%\/12,12*30,270000)     The total of all loan payments will be .  So the total interest paid will be .     , or        Emile bought a car for $24,000 three years ago. The loan had a 5-year term at 3% APR. How much does he still owe on the car?   First, we need to find out the amount of the monthly payments for this loan.   , which gives   or =PMT(3%\/12,12*5,24000)   The amount still owed three years later, is the present value of the two years of remaining payments on the loan.   , which gives   or =PV(3%\/12,12*2,-431.25)     A friend bought a house 15 years ago, taking out a $120,000 mortgage at 6% APR for 30 years. How much does she still owe on the mortgage?   First, we need to find out the amount of the monthly payments for this loan.   , which gives   or =PMT(6%\/12,12*30,120000)   The amount still owed fifteen years later, is the present value of the fifteen years of remaining payments on the loan.   , which gives   or =PV(6%\/12,12*15,-719.46)      Use a spreadsheet (not formulas) to answer problems 9 through 13 below.    Imagine you have $20,000 saved as a down payment on a house. You wish to take out a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan at 4% APR (remember that mortgage rates usually assume monthly compounding). If the maximum mortgage payment you can afford is $950 per month, then what is the maximum house price that you can afford?    =PV(4%\/12,12*30,950) which gives $198,988.18.  Now add $20,000 to this balance, which gives $218,988.18.    Suppose another mortgage lender offers you a fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.95% APR. You have $20,000 saved as a down payment, and you can afford a maximum mortgage payment of $950 per month. You are interested in a certain house for sale, with firm selling price of $200,000.     Find the monthly payment for this house. Can you afford it, under the terms of this lender?    (Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house? If so, state the minimum number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.          =PMT(2.95%\/12,12*15,180000,0) which gives $1,238.72.  You cannot afford this home.    Using trial-and-error: The minimum number of additional years is 8. There is a 23 year loan period, 3.35% APR, and $936.24 monthly payment.       An annuity firm pays 5% APR compounded yearly, and offers an investor the following: Deposit $100,000 with them today, and then starting one year from today, you will receive ten equal annual payments, with zero balance remaining afterward in the account. If an investor accepts their offer, then find the following:     What will be the payment amount for each of the ten equal payments?    After ten years, how much interest will the investor have received, and what percentage of the total payment sum will represent interest?          =PMT(5%,10,100000,0) which gives $12,950.46.    The total payments will be $129,504.60.  The interest is the amount over the $100,000 initial investment, or $29,504.60.  The percentage of the total payment sum representing interest will be , or approximately 22.7827%.       For twelve full years, and into an account that pays 3.5% APR compounded quarterly: Yanhong will either pay $1500 at the end of each calendar quarter, or, deposit a single lump sum that will give the same future value amount.     If Yanhong chooses the single lump sum option, then how much will Yanhong need to deposit?    If Yanhong needs to have earned $100,000 in this account at the end of the twelve years, then the quarterly deposit amount will need to be increased. What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be?    (Challenge): If Yanhong will make quarterly deposits into this account for the twelve years, but also has $8,000 to additionally deposit into this account right away: What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be, so that the total balance after twelve years is $100,000?          =PV(3.5%\/4,4*12,1500) which gives $58,586.02.     =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000) which gives $1,685.34.     =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,-8000,100000) which gives $1,480.51.  (Note 8000 is input as negative, to signify a payment.)  Note this answer can also be found by subtracting the future value of $8000 here, which equals $12,153.47, from the required ending balance of $100,000 (which leaves $87,846.47) and then using the PMT function:   =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000-12153.47) which again gives $1,480.51.  This can also be done in nested fashion (be careful to add the negative FV quantity): =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000+FV(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,8000)) .       Assume you take out a 30-year mortgage loan for $250,000 at a fixed 4.5% APR.     What will be the amount of your monthly payment?    After the first ten years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?    After the first twenty years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?    Notice that the amount of the loan balance reduction during the second ten years, was very considerably bigger than the amount of the loan balance reduction during the first ten years. Why does the loan balance decrease at a faster and faster pace, the longer that the loan has been in repayment?          =PMT(4.5%\/12,12*30,250000) which gives $1,266.71.    This will be the present value of the remaining 240 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*20,1266.71) which gives $200,223.07.    This will be the present value of the remaining 120 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*10,1266.71) which gives $122,223.99.    At the beginning of the repayment period, most of each payment goes to interest (thus the loan balance reduces very slowly at first). Over time, more of each payment shifts to principal, and less to interest. At the end of the loan repayment period, nearly all the payment is going to principal.         For each of the following scenarios, determine which formula from sections 3.2-3.4 to use and solve the problem.    Keisha received an inheritance of $20,000 and invested it at 6.9% APR, compounded continuously. How much will she have for college in 8 years?    =20000*EXP(0.069*8) = $34,734.46. Keisha will have $34,734.46 in 8 years.    Paul wants to buy a new car. Rather than take out a loan, he decides to save $200 a month in an account earning 3.5% APR compounded monthly. How much will he have saved up after 3 years?    =FV(0.035\/12,3*12,200,0) = $7,579.95. Paul will have $7,579.95 in 3 years.    Sol is managing investments for a non-profit company. They want to invest some money in an account earning 5% APR compounded annually with the goal to have $30,000 in the account in 6 years. How much should Sol deposit into the account?    =PV(0.05\/1,6*1,0,30000) = $22,386.46. Sol should deposit $22,386.46 to have $30,000 in 6 years.    Miao is going to finance new office equipment at 2.8% APR over a 4-year term. If she can afford monthly payments of $100, how much equipment can she buy?    =PV(0.028\/12,4*12,100,0) = $4,535.96. Miao can finance $4,535.96 in equipment to have a monthly loan payment of $100 for 4 years.    How much would you need to save every month in an account earning 4.1% APR to have $5,000 saved up in two years.    =PMT(0.041\/12,2*12,0,5000) = $200.26. You would need to save $200.26 every month to have $5,000 in 2 years.    Terry and Jess are buying a house for $405,000 and they can afford to put 10% down. Their interest rate is 4.3% APR for 30 years. What will their monthly mortgage payment be?    =PMT(0.043\/12,30*12,364500,0) = $1,803.81. Their mortgage payment would be $1,803.81.    You loan your sister $500 for two years and she agrees to pay you back with 3% simple interest per year. How much will she pay you back    =500+500*.03*2 = $530. Your sister should pay you back $530 in 2 years.    Zahid starts saving $150 per month in an account that pays 4.8% APR compounded monthly. If he continues for 20 years, how much will he have? If he waited 10 years instead and put in $300 per month for 10 years with the same interest, how much would he have?   For the first plan: =FV(0.048\/12,20*12,150,0) = $60,251.26. Zahid would have $60,251.26 if he puts in $150 per month for 20 years.  For the second plan: =FV(0.048\/12,10*12,300,0) = $46,089.59. Zahid would only have $46,089.59 if he waited and put in $300 per month for 10 years.     "

  "body": " Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much will her monthly car payment be for each loan and how do these loans compare to each other.   To use a spreadsheet, we use the =PMT formula. For a loan, the loan amount is the present value and the future value is 0, indicating that the loan will be paid off. Teresa is making a down payment, so we also need to subtract that from the cost of the car to find the loan amount:     Her loan amount is $12,000. For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.0275\/12, 12*3, 12000, 0)   and get a result of $347.65.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the formula, we use the one solved for :   , for 2.75% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 3 years   , since she can pay $3,000 of the $15,000     Teresa's car payment would be $347.65.  Now for the 5-year loan at 4% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.04\/12, 12*5, 12000, 0)   and we get $221.00.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , for 4% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 5 years   , the loan amount     Now let's compare the loans by finding out how much Teresa would pay in interest for each loan.    For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $515.40.    For the 5-year loan at 4% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $1,260.00.    There are two main differences between these two loans: the monthly payments and the total paid over the life of the loans. The first loan has a higher monthly payment by $126.65 per month. However, she would pay $744.60 less in interest.   "

In this figure below, we have sliders to change the original principle of the loan P , the annual percentage rate r , the number of years of the loan Y , and the property tax p_tax . The blue horizontal line is the amount of each monthly payment needed. The red line is the amount of each of those payments going toward interest. Thus, the blue area is the total payments towards principle, and the red area is the total payments towards interest. The orange area represents escrow payments for property taxes and insurance.    If the embedded Desmos page above is too small, you can go to the Desmos page .    Set P equal to $130,000. What number does the area of the blue region correspond to? The area of the blue region corresponds to P , the principle of the loan, or $130,000. (2 points)  Try moving the r and Y sliders around. Does the area of the blue region tend to stay the same, get larger, or get smaller as you make these changes? The area of the blue region stays the same. (2 points)  Given what you know about how loans work, why would this be the case? For their explanation, mark correct if you can tell that they know that this is because the area of the blue region corresponds to the original principle. (2 points)  Suppose you have a budget for $700 a month for a home. Also suppose that you can get an interest rate of 4%, and that you are looking for a 30 year loan. Move the Principle P around to find the maximum house price you can afford. What is it? For this question, you will get full credit as long as you are close enough. In order to get full credit, you need to be within $1,000 of the correct answer. Make sure that you factor in that you will have to make escrow payments. Answer should be $120,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by, unless their answer is about $111,000, in which case take off 1 point becaused that means they were confused by escrow payments.  In the situation from the last part, what percentage of your money goes towards interest over the life of the loan? The amount of money going toward interest is 41.77% (2 point). It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or their number is close enough.  Use the same information from part , but change the length of the loan to 15 years. Now what is the maximum house price you can afford? What now is the percentage of your money going towards interest?   Answer should be $81,000 or $82,000. (4 points) Mark off for every $1000 they are off by.  The amount of money going toward interest is 24.80% (2 points). It is okay if they round to a different number of decimals or are close enough.    Given your answer to the task above, how would you explain to someone that a 15-year loan has less than twice the monthly payments of a 30 year loan? (6 points) Give at least 3 points for an answer that is coherent. Give full credit for an explanation that basically says that paying off the loan faster means that less money goes toward interest.  Keeping everything else constant, change the annual percentage rate r . Explain how a rising interest rate could be considered to make all home buyers a little poorer. (6 points) Give at least 3 points for an answer that is coherent. Give full credit for an explanation that basically says anything similar to, Rising interest rates cause mortgages to be more expensive, thus causing homes to be more expensive.   Imagine that you have $4,000 in credit card debt, and you'd like to pay it off in 10 years. Your credit card company charges 20% on your debt. How much per month will you have to pay?

Given the credit card situation from the last part, how much will you have to pay if you try to pay it off in 5 years? $105.98 (3 points) Give full credit if they are within $6.  Given your answer to the last two parts, explain to your friend why it is important to pay credit card debt off as soon as possible. (6 points) Give at least 3 points for anything coherent.

This will be the present value of the remaining 240 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*20,1266.71) which gives $200,223.07.    This will be the present value of the remaining 120 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*10,1266.71) which gives $122,223.99.    At the beginning of the repayment period, most of each payment goes to interest (thus the loan balance reduces very slowly at first). Over time, more of each payment shifts to principal, and less to interest. At the end of the loan repayment period, nearly all the payment is going to principal.     "

  "body": " Income Taxes   Income Taxes   Students will be able to:     Calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI)    Determine the standard deduction according to filing status    Determine whether to use the standard or itemized deductions and calculate taxable income    Calculate income tax from tables    Compare taxes owed to withholdings to determine whether a refund is due or a payment is required         A Very Brief History of Taxes  Although Benjamin Franklin famously claimed in 1789 that “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”, it wasn’t until 1913 that the 16th amendment was ratified, and income tax was legalized. Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A poll tax , also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.  Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)!    Types of Income Tax   Income tax is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.    Federal Income Tax  Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your filing status and taxable income .    State Income Tax  Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.    Municipal Income Tax  Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.    Calculating Federal Income Tax  Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.   Steps to Calculate Federal Income Tax   Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money.      Gross Income   Gross income includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!    Adjusted Gross Income   Adjustments are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.    Taxable Income   Taxable income is determined by subtracting your deductions from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take either a standard deduction , which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to itemize your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.  Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim personal exemptions . Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.  Let’s look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).   Sasha received $45,000 in wages and earned $1,300 in interest from his savings plan. He paid $1,400 in student loan interest, and put $4,000 into his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Determine Sasha’s adjusted gross income.  To calculate Sasha’s adjusted gross income, we need to first determine his gross income. His gross income includes his wages and earned interest:  Gross Income   To find his adjusted gross income, we need to subtract eligible adjustments from his gross income. His eligible adjustments include the interest paid on his student loans, and his contributions to his IRA:  Adjusted Gross Income      Filing Status  Your filing status is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.    Single: If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.     Married Filing Jointly: If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)     Married Filing Separately: If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.     Head of Household (with qualifying person): If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).     Qualifying Widow\/Widower (with dependent child): This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.     Your filing status determines your standard deduction and tax liability. The standard deduction for each filing status for the tax year 2022 is given in the table below.     Filing Status  Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2022    Single  $12,950.    Married Filing Jointly  $25,900    Married Filing Separately  $12,950    Head of Household  $19,400    Qualifying Widow  $25,900     Here is an example where we calculate adjusted gross income and taxable income.    Maria earned wages of $32,400 from her job as a server. She also earned $8,300 in tips, and received $95 in interest from a savings account. In trying to save for retirement, Maria has put $3,500 into a 401K tax deferred savings plan. She is unmarried and lives with her six year old daughter. Determine Maria’s gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income.    Maria’s gross income includes her wages, tips, and earned interest.  Gross Income = $32,400 + $8,300 + $95 = $40,795  Maria can use her 401k contribution as an adjustment.  Adjusted Gross Income = $40,795 - $3,500 = $37,295  Since Maria is unmarried and is the primary caregiver for her daughter, she can file as the head of household and take the standard deduction of $19,400.  Taxable Income = $37,295 - $19,400 = $17,895      Gracie and Lancel are a couple. Below is a list of relevant information regarding their income taxes.    Gracie and Lancel are married with no kids, filing jointly. No one can claim either as a dependent.  Together, they earned $106,900 of wage income  They did not earn anything from interest, dividends, distributions, annuities, benefits, capital gains, or anything else.  They plan to take the standard deduction.  They contributed more than $600 to their church (According to instructions from the IRS, for a couple filing jointly who take the standard deduction, the maximum amount they can claim is $600).  They had no qualified business income  They can claim $2250 in adjustments to income because Gracie is an elementary teacher who can mark $250 for educator expenses and they can claim $2000 because of their payments toward the interest of their student loans.       Fill out boxes 1-15 the form to find the couple's taxable income      Usually tax owed is looked up from a tax table. You would use the first line of the table if the taxable income from line 6 is at least 78,000 but less than 78,050.  Write this as a compound inequality, using to represent the income from line 6.  Then use the table provided to determine the tax the couple owes.              Box 1 should be 106,900  Boxes 2a-8 should be 0  Box 9 should be 106,700  Box 10 should be 2,250  Box 11 should be 104,450  Box 12a should be 25,900  Box 12b should be 600  Box 12c should be 26,500  Boxes 13 and 14 should be 0  Box 15 should be 78,150     Line 16 give $8,970.         Tax Tables  The United States has a progressive federal income tax system which means the more income you have, the more you generally pay in taxes. There are marginal tax rates that go up according to our income, but we don’t pay the same rate on all of our income. The ranges of income are called tax brackets and the buckets in the illustration below can help us visualize the brackets.  The cutoff values in the figure are for a married couple filing jointly, but the percentages are the same for everyone as you’ll see in the table on the next page. We pay 10% of any taxable income in the first bucket. If the first bucket is full, we move to the second bucket and we pay 12% of that income. This couple is in the 22% tax bracket because the 3rd bucket is partially filled. They will pay 22% of the income in that bucket, but they are not paying 22% of their entire income.   Tax Buckets by John Chesbrough, licensed under CC-BY-ND-NC 4.0 .   A drawing that shows the tax brackets as buckets being filled from a hose labeled taxable income; the first bucket for the 10% tax bracket is full and has the range of $0-19,050; the second bucket for the 12% tax bracket is also full and has the range of $19051-77,400; the third bucket for the 22% bracket is partially full and has the range of $77,401-165,000; there are buckets for the 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% tax brackets which are empty. The cutoff values for all of these brackets are given in the next table.    Here is a table with cutoff values for each filing status. Everyone pays a tax of 10% on any income in the first tax bracket. Then we all pay 12% of the next bracket of income, 22% of the next bracket, and so on. This keeps going up to the 37% tax bracket.    2022 Tax Year Marginal Tax Rates    Marginal Tax Rate On Taxable Income  Filing Single  Filing as Head of Household  Married filing Jointly  Married filing Separately    10%  First $10,275  First $14,650  First $20,550  First $10,275    12%  $10,276 to $41,775  $14,651 to $55,900  $20,551 to $83,550  $10,276 to $41,775    22%  $41,776 to $89,075  $55,901 to $89,050.  $83,551 to $178,150.  $41,776 to $89,075    24%  $89,076 to $170,050.  $89,051 to $170,050  $178,151 to $340,100.  $89,076 to $170,050.    32%  $170,051 to $215,950  $170,051 to $215,950  $340,101 to $431,900  $170,051 to $215,950    35%  $215,951 to $539,900  $215,951 to $539,900  $431,901 to $647,850  $215,951 to $323,925    37%  $539,901 or more  $539,901 or more  $647,851 or more  $323,926 or more      Let’s see how to use this table to calculate taxes in an example.    If Avery is filing single and has $55,100 in taxable income, calculate their tax.    We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $9,525. Since their income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Avery’s taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $38,700 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:      Avery would owe $7,739 in taxes. Note that their overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by their taxable income:   or about 14%    We could calculate all taxes this way, but you might notice that the first few terms will be the same if the buckets are full. For this reason, we can simplify these tax tables. The tax tables below give the value for all of the lower tax buckets that are full. There is a tax table for each filing status and the cutoffs are regularly adjusted for inflation, so they usually vary from year to year.  The next four tables give the tax calculations for 2022 federal income taxes by filing status.    Filing as Single (Tax Year 2022)    If taxable income is:  The tax is:    $0 to $10,275  10% of the taxable income    $10,276 to $41,775  $1,027.50 plus 12% of the amount over $10,275.    $41,776 to $89,075  $4,807.50 plus 22% of the amount over $41,775.    $89,076 to $170,050  $15,213.50 plus 24% of the amount over $89,075.    $170,051 to $215,950  $34,647.50 plus 32% of the amount over $170,050.    $215,951 to $539,900  $49,335.50 plus 35% of the amount over $215,950.    $539,901 or more  $162,718 plus 37% of the amount over $539,900.

Suppose Adira is filing as head of household and has a taxable income of $96,450. Calculate her taxes using the individual tax brackets and with the simplified table.    Using the simplified tax table for single filing status, we see that Adira’s taxable income puts her in the 24% tax bracket. The simplified table tells us that her taxes will be equal to $15,213.50 plus 24% of the amount over $89,075. To find the excess over $89,075, we subtract $89,075 from her taxable income. Thus, her taxes are:         Phyl and Gladys are married and filing jointly. Together their taxable income is $112,000. Use the simplified 2022 tax tables from this section to determine how much they owe in taxes.    Since Phyl and Gladys are married and filing jointly, their taxable income puts them in the 22% tax bracket. Using the simplified 2022 tax table, their taxes are $9,615 plus 22% of the amount over $83,550:     Phyl and Gladys owe $15,874 in taxes.         Consider Gracie and Lancel's taxes from . Try calculating their income tax based on . It ought to be different by a couple cents. Why do you think that is the case?    A commonly held belief is that marginal tax rate applies to all of a person's taxable income. What is 12% of their taxable income, and how does this compare to actual income tax?    What percent of their taxable income are they paying? This is called the effective or average tax rate. Round your answer to a tenth of a percentage point.    Sometimes people have been hesitant to accept raises, worried that it will push them into a new tax bracket and they'll end up losing money.  Suppose the couple got an unexpected $6,000 bonus at the end of the year, pushing them into the 22% marginal rate tax bracket. How much tax will they pay?    What is the difference between their take-home pay with and without the bonus? Will the couple end up with less take-home pay because the bonus pushed them into a higher tax bracket?          Taxable income is not over $83,550, so we'll use the second row  Tax will be $2,055 plus 12% of the excess over $20,550  $78,150 - $20,550 = $57,600 excess  12% of $57,600 = $6,912  $2,055 + $6,912 = $8,967  It's off by $3, because the table is providing an average value based on the range of taxable incomes. But it's close enough to tell the two are consistent.     , which is about $400 more than their actual taxes due.    $8,970\/$78,150 11.5%  Answer will be basically the same if they use $8,967 as the tax.    Taxable income will now be $84,150, so the tax will now be calculated using  $9,615 plus 22% of the amount over $83,550.  $84,150-$83,550 = $800 excess. 22% of $800 = $176  Taxes owed: $9,615 + $176 = $9,791    Original: $106,900 income - $8,970 taxes = $97,930 take home pay.  After: $112,900 income - $9,791 taxes = $103,109 take home pay.  Even though they were pushed into a new marginal bracket, the bonus still increased their take-home income by $2573.         Tax Credits   Tax credits are different from deductions in that they reduce the amount of tax you owe by the full amount of the credit, not just a percentage. This makes credits much more valuable than deductions.  Common tax credits include child tax credits, earned income credits, child and dependent care credits, American opportunity tax credits, lifetime learning credits, and various federal energy credits.    Sean is in the 22% tax bracket and itemizes his deductions. How much will his tax bill be reduced if he makes a $1,000 contribution to charity? How much will his bill be reduced if he gets a $1,000 tax credit?    The tax credit will reduce his tax bill by the full amount of the credit, so the $1,000 tax credit will reduce his tax bill by $1,000. As a deduction, however, his contribution to charity will only reduce his tax bill by 22% of the $1,000, or 0.22($1,000) = $220. Tax credits are always better than deductions.      Calculating a Refund or Payment Due  Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don’t all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let’s look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.    John’s taxes are $4,342.50. He can claim an American opportunity tax credit of $2,300 and he had $4,135 withheld from his paychecks. Determine if John will owe money or get a refund.    The first step is to reduce John’s taxes by the full amount of the tax credit.     Next we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.     John will receive a refund of $1,092.50. Notice that having a negative amount after subtracting credits and withholdings means you will receive a refund, while having a positive amount means you still owe money.      As we discovered in , Phyl and Gladys owe $15,874 in taxes. Their employers withheld $8,980 and they received a $7,500 credit for their purchase of an electric car. Will they receive a refund, or will they need to make a payment?    To determine whether they will receive a refund or if they will still owe money, we will first subtract the full amount of the electric car credit.     We now subtract their withholdings:     Since the value is negative, Phyl and Gladys will receive a tax refund of $606.      While tax tables and the tax rates work well for calculating tax for a single individual, a business might want to create a spreadsheet that automatically calculates the tax for their employees.   For simplicity, let's assume all of the employees are married and filing jointly, and all of their taxable incomes fall between $20,551 and $83,550. Let's also assume that they will take the standard deduction, have no other income, make no adjustments to their taxable income, and give nothing to charity. These assumptions will be close enough for this company's purposes.    Write an equation for cell C2. It should be general enough to be copied down the rest of the column.    Write an equation for cell D2. It should be general enough to be copied down the rest of the column.              Tax is $1,990 plus 12% of the amount over $19,900. alternately, they could have simplified:          Exercises   Which decreases your tax bill more, a credit or a deduction?   A credit decreases your bill more. It decreases your bill by the full amount of the credit. A deduction only decreases your tax bill by a percentage.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a credit of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $500.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a deduction of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $60 because 12% of $500 is $60.    Can you take the standard deduction and itemize your deductions?   No, you must choose to take either the standard deduction or itemized deductions.    Can you make adjustments to your income and take the standard deduction?   Yes, you can make adjustments and take a deduction. Adjustments to your income happen before deductions.    If you decide to take the standard deduction what have you considered?   If you decide to take the standard deduction you determine that itemizing would not save you more money.    Selah has paid $11,500 in mortgage interest which she can take as a deduction and has $1,500 in other deductions that she can take this year. She is filing as single. Should she itemize her deductions or take the standard deduction?   She should itemize because itemizing reduces her taxable income by $13,000. The standard deduction would have reduced her taxable income by $12,000.    If you are married do you have to file your taxes together?   You can either file as married filing jointly or married filing separately.    Fredrick is concerned about the effect of a raise on his taxes. He’s getting a raise of $3,000, putting him into a higher tax bracket by $1,000 dollars. He’s concerned about his entire income being taxed at 22% instead of 12%. Should he be concerned? Why or why not?   No, he should not be concerned. Only the $1000 will be taxed at 22%. The rest of his income will be taxed at a lower level.     A single person with taxable income of $95,000 will have the first $10,275. of that income taxed at what rate? Determine the taxes owed on just the first $10,275..   The first $10,275. will be taxed at 10% resulting in $1,027.50 owed in taxes.    A single person with taxable income of $185,000 will have the first $10,275 of that income taxed at a different rate than the income between $10,275 and $41,775. Determine the taxes owed on just the second bracket.   There is a total of $31,500 between $10,275 and $41,775. 12% of $29,175 is $3,780.    Determine the income tax owed for a single person who has $80,000 of taxable income.   $80,000 falls into the third tax bracket. The ammount over $41,775 is ($80,000 - $41,775) = $38,225. Thus, the income tax owed is       Doug and Christina are filing jointly. They owe $16,589 in taxes. Throughout the year they had $13,456 withheld from their paychecks, and they can claim an energy credit of $2,500 for purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Determine the amount they will need to pay or will get refunded.   $16,589 in taxes minus $13,456 for withholdings, and they can claim and $2,500 in credits. This leaves them owing $633.    Heather owes $7,589 in taxes. Throughout the year she had $6,456 withheld from her paychecks and she can claim an education credit of $1,980. Determine the amount she will need to pay or will get refunded.   $7,589 in taxes minus $6,456 for withholdings and education credit of $1,980. This leaves her refunded $847.    Determine the amount of taxes owed or the refund that would result in this situation:     Filing Status: Married filing jointly    Gross Income: $125,000    Adjustments: $5,600    Itemized Deductions: $11,400    Credits: $15,000     What is their adjusted gross income (AGI)?    Should they itemize or take the standard deduction?    Use the simplified 2022 tax tables to determine their taxes.    What is their final tax refund or amount still owed?            Take the income minus the adjustments . Their adjusted gross income is $119,400.    They should take the standard deduction because itemizing saves them less.    Taxable income:   Taxes owed:   They owe $11,815 in taxes.     Take the taxes owed minus credits and withholdings. They will receive a refund for $3,185.       Francis and Edward are planning to get married and they want to determine whether there is an advantage or disadvantage to marrying before the end of the year and filing their taxes jointly.

  "body": "     Consider Gracie and Lancel's taxes from . Try calculating their income tax based on . It ought to be different by a couple cents. Why do you think that is the case?    A commonly held belief is that marginal tax rate applies to all of a person's taxable income. What is 12% of their taxable income, and how does this compare to actual income tax?    What percent of their taxable income are they paying? This is called the effective or average tax rate. Round your answer to a tenth of a percentage point.    Sometimes people have been hesitant to accept raises, worried that it will push them into a new tax bracket and they'll end up losing money.  Suppose the couple got an unexpected $6,000 bonus at the end of the year, pushing them into the 22% marginal rate tax bracket. How much tax will they pay?    What is the difference between their take-home pay with and without the bonus? Will the couple end up with less take-home pay because the bonus pushed them into a higher tax bracket?          Taxable income is not over $83,550, so we'll use the second row  Tax will be $2,055 plus 12% of the excess over $20,550  $78,150 - $20,550 = $57,600 excess  12% of $57,600 = $6,912  $2,055 + $6,912 = $8,967  It's off by $3, because the table is providing an average value based on the range of taxable incomes. But it's close enough to tell the two are consistent.     , which is about $400 more than their actual taxes due.    $8,970\/$78,150 11.5%  Answer will be basically the same if they use $8,967 as the tax.    Taxable income will now be $84,150, so the tax will now be calculated using  $9,615 plus 22% of the amount over $83,550.  $84,150-$83,550 = $800 excess. 22% of $800 = $176  Taxes owed: $9,615 + $176 = $9,791    Original: $106,900 income - $8,970 taxes = $97,930 take home pay.  After: $112,900 income - $9,791 taxes = $103,109 take home pay.  Even though they were pushed into a new marginal bracket, the bonus still increased their take-home income by $2573.      "

Dr. Taylor attributes material from the National Numeracy Network as part of collaboration with the SERC Pedagogic Service.      Make explicit assumptions that guide calculations for a loosely defined problem.  Use spreadsheets to perform unit conversions, budget costs, etc.  Use geometry (including volumes, surface areas, etc.) to solve a real world planning project.  Apply personal knowledge and skills related to personal finance. Specifically, work with regular payments and with lump sum payments.  Incorporate tables and graphs in a paper, with descriptive references to these materials in the body of the paper.     Details  Grace College was founded in 1948. You have been elected to serve as chair of the planning committee for the upcoming Centennial (100th anniversary celebration). The celebration is to be held on a Friday night, early in September of 2048. The planning committee has three main responsibilities:    Plan and budget for the elaborate dinner party for the entire Grace College Community (students, faculty, and staff). Appetizers, main courses (regular, vegetarian, and allergen-free), dessert, and beverages are to be provided. Before the College approaches specific catering services, you need to pull together and neatly present relevant details about the expected college community’s population (e.g., percent with food allergies, percent who will drink water vs more expensive drinks, total population size, etc.) to estimate the amount and types of food and drink needed. You also need to provide fairly detailed estimates of expenses for the food and drink desired and for the hourly service fees for the servers and any other relevant expenses.    Plan and budget for the giant Centennial cake to be displayed on Beta field for the first two weeks of the school year. The decorative (but non-edible) cake is to measure 15 feet in diameter. The President of the College did not specify a particular height for the giant cake; he merely asked that it be of reasonable “cake proportions.” The specifics are up to you. The hollow, decorative cake is to be made of a wooden frame covered with plywood and is to be filled with red, black, and white helium balloons. (The balloons will be released at the end of the dinner party.) You need to provide the specific design instructions for making this cake and need to budget for its construction, decoration, and filling (with the appropriate number of balloons). Students will make the cake, so there’s no need to budget for labor, only for materials.    Arrange for the funding of the Centennial celebration. The total costs of the dinner party, the giant decorative cake, and the fireworks display (which is to follow the release of the balloons from the cake and is estimated to cost $25,000) are to be covered by the Centennial Fund. Plan A is to get a donor to deposit enough money this year so that with interest payments, the accumulated balance in 2048 will fully cover all the costs. (Note: You are NOT to actually contact any potential donors! Just calculate how much money would need to be invested now to pay for the party and related expenses.) If Plan A doesn’t work, there’s Plan B: set aside donations each month starting next September so that costs will be covered. You need to describe each of these plans and explain the calculations.      Assignment  As chair of Grace College’s Centennial Planning Committee, you are to prepare a professional-looking report detailing the plans, budgets, and funding arrangements described above. The report should be typed (Times New Roman, 12 point font, one inch margins is the standard report style) and appropriate charts and graphs and diagrams should accompany the report. These charts, graphs, and diagrams should be labeled (e.g., Table 3: Cost Estimates for Beverages, Figure 2: 3-D Illustration of the Giant Cake) and should be referred to in the content of the report.  The report should begin with a one to three paragraph executive summary. (Busy people like college administrators want to know the “conclusions” up front.) After the executive summary, use appropriate section headings to separate the other key parts of the detailed report. In each section of the report, be sure to spell out key assumptions, explain how calculations are made, etc. Please type out your equations (see help videos for Microsoft Word , Mac Pages , or come ask me if you need help)  You may work on your own or in teams of two or three students. (Three is the absolute maximum – no exceptions.) If you work in a team, you will all get the same grade on the project. You need to handle all team issues (division of labor, work effort, etc.) on your own. However, if would like to break up your group or vote out a member, I am willing to act as your arbitrator. If you have questions about this project, you can see me during my office hours.  I’m open to other project ideas. If you have an idea for a different project involving estimation, planning, and budgeting, check with me so I can make sure it is equivalent.  If you have questions, please see me. Have fun with this project and good luck!

But if we cannot distinguish credible information from misleading information, then we are vulnerable to manipulation and making decisions that are not in our best interest. Statistics provides tools for us to evaluate information critically. In this sense, statistics is one of the most important things to know about.  Statistics are often presented to add credibility to an argument. To give some examples, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)   4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.    Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.    Condoms are effective 94% of the time.    People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.    Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.    A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.    People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.    There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.    79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.     All these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, you have probably heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Data and data-interpretation show up in virtually every facet of contemporary life.  Many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading and push you into decisions that you might regret. This chapter will help you learn the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.    Statistical Process  To give you an overview, here is a diagram of the steps taken in a poll or other statistical study, and the elements in each step that we will discuss in this chapter. We will use many examples to illustrate the whole process.    5 rectangles indicating the 5 steps of the statistical process; 1. Identify the group you want to study, which is the population; 2. Identify the quantity you want to know about the population, which is the parameter; 3. Gather data by taking an unbiased sample or performing an experiment; 4. Graph the data and calculate statistics; 5. Estimate the parameter that you wanted to know with the margin of error and confidence interval.      Population  Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The population could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.  If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College. Or it might be:   All community college students in the state of Oregon.    All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    And so on.     The intended population is also called the target population , since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.    A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?    While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.      Parameter  A parameter is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and\/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.    Sample  To estimate the parameter, we select a sample , which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a representative sample , one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.    Statistic  To get our data , we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or raw data . Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A statistic is a value (percentage, average, etc.) calculated using data from a sample.    A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Portland feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to the Pioneer Place Mall and survey 500 shoppers. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic.     Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.   Statistic : The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.      Sampling  As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don’t register? Registered voters may not vote. What about likely voters?   This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a likely voter.  Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.   So, identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose a good sample? We want our statistic to estimate the parameter we are interested in, so we need to have a representative sample. Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from customers at a Starbucks, or your list of TikTok followers. How do we get a sample that resembles our population?    Sampling Methods  One way to get a representative sample is to use randomness. We will look at three types of sampling that use randomness and one that does not.    Simple random sample (SRS)  A simple random sample , abbreviated SRS, is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.   If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called sampling variation . If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.    Stratified sampling  In stratified sampling , a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup. It is often desirable to make the sample sizes proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population.   Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.   A way to remember stratified sampling is think about having a piece of layer cake. Each layer represents a stratum or subgroup, and a slice of the cake represents a sample of each layer.    Systematic sampling  In systematic sampling , every member of the population is selected to be in the sample. The starting position is often chosen at random.   To select a systematic sample, Portland Community College could use their database to select a random student from the first 100 student ID numbers. Then they would select every 100th student ID number after that. Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friend’s because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.     Convenience sampling   Convenience sampling is when samples are chosen by selecting whomever is convenient. This is the worst type of sampling because it does not use randomness.   A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to them. This is a convenience sample.     Statistical Bias  There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is very important to think through the entire study and data analysis before we start. We talked about sampling or selection bias , which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias , which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate. This can lead to bias if the people who volunteer have different characteristics than the general population. Here is a summary of some additional sources of bias.    Types of bias   Sampling bias – when the sample is not representative of the population   Voluntary response bias – the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is made up of volunteers   Self-interest study – bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome   Response bias – when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason   Perceived lack of anonymity – when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them   Loaded questions – when the question wording influences the responses   Non-response bias – when people refuse to participate in a study or drop out of an experiment, we can no longer be certain that our sample is representative of the population  Sources of bias may be conscious or unconscious. They may be innocent or as intentional as pressuring by a pollster. Here are some examples of the types of bias.      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers Reuters. http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/nm\/20090423\/od_uk_nm\/oukoe_uk_gum_learning . Retrieved 4\/27\/09 . This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn’t have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.      Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. Also of concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. Here is an example from a psychology researcher Swartz, Norbert. http:\/\/www.umich.edu\/~newsinfo\/MT\/01\/Fal01\/mt6f01.html Retrieved 3\/31\/2009 :    My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.      Observational Studies  So far, we have primarily discussed surveys and polls, which are types of observational studies – studies based on observations or measurements. These observations may be solicited, like in a survey or poll. Or, they may be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a no turn on red sign.    Experiments  In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded. When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested. Here are some examples of treatments.      A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer’s disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.    A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.    A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people’s mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state’s standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.  The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.        Confounding   Confounding occurs when there are two or more potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not possible to determine which one actually caused the result.      A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.    Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.      There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.    Control group  In experiments, the participants are typically divided into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.  Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of each gender identity, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is very commonly used.      To determine if a two-day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two-day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups took the SAT test.    A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields that typically produce the same amount of food. The treatment group receives the new plant food and the control group does not. The crop yields would then be compared. By growing the two crops at the same time in similar fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.      Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine, or a response to have something. This is called a placebo effect.    Placebo effect  The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient’s perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.   A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine. Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL. (1981) Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain. Pain. 10:379-89.    To control for the placebo effect, a placebo , or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.    Placebo and Placebo-controlled experiments  An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo-controlled experiment.      In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.    In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a placebo.    In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control group could be given standard frozen meals taken out of their original packaging.      In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the second group, called a comparison group . In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison. It is very important to consider the ethical ramifications of any experiment.    Blind studies  A blind study is one that uses a placebo and the participants do not know whether they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which the subjects and those interacting with them don’t know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.   In a study about anti-depression medication, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether a patient is in the treatment or control group, as it might influence their evaluation. The experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.     Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals  Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn’t expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.  You’ve probably heard something like, The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent. The 3% is called the margin of error , so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a confidence interval , we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).  The most common confidence level is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.    Let’s say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Portland Community College and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).  Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.      Exercises   Describe the difference between a sample and a population.   A sample is a sub group of the population. A population is the entire group of subjects.    Describe the difference between a statistic and a parameter.   A Statistic is a measurement obtained from the data taken from a sample. A parameter is a measurement obtained from the data of the entire population.    The Grace College randomly selects 200 students from Beta and Alpha dorms to participate in a childcare survey in order to determine the demand for additional parking for students.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?      The intended population is all Grace students.   All PCC Students    200 students from the Alpha and Beta dorms.    The collected data is not representative of all Grace students since it only includes responses from students living in two dorms. This is an example of sampling bias.       A local research firm randomly selects 400 homes in Kosciusko County to determine support for adding compost pick up to residents’ regular garbage service.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?         The intended population is all Kosciusko County residences.    400 homes in Kosciusko County    The collected data is likely representative since residences were selected at random from the entire county.       A political scientist surveys 28 of the current 106 representatives in a state's congress. Of them, 14 said they were supporting a new education bill, 12 said there were not supporting the bill, and 2 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of representatives surveyed who said they were supporting the education bill.    If the margin of error was 5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of representatives we might we expect to support the education bill and explain what the confidence interval tells us.

The population size is     The sample size is in     The statistic is or 50%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of the state congress representatives in support of the new education (the parameter) likely lies between 45% and 55%.       The city of Raleigh has 9,500 registered voters. There are two candidates for city council in an upcoming election: Brown and Feliz. The day before the election, a telephone poll of 350 randomly selected registered voters was conducted. 112 said they'd vote for Brown, 207 said they'd vote for Feliz, and 31 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of voters surveyed who said they'd vote for Brown.    If the margin of error was 3.5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of voters surveyed that we might we expect to vote for Brown and explain what the confidence interval tells us.         All registered voters in the city of Raleigh.    The population size is     The sample size is     The statistic is or 32%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of registered voters who will vote for Brown is likely to lie between 28.5% and 35.5%.

They randomly divide the subjects into two groups. Group 1 receives new HPV vaccine, and Group 2 receives the existing HPV vaccine. The patients in the study do not know which group they are in.     Which is the treatment group?    Which is the control group (if there is one)?    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?

Describe a controlled experiment the farmer could use to test his theory.   Play Barry Manilow to half the crop and don’t play any music to the other half of the crop.    A sports psychologist believes that people are more likely to be extroverted as an adult if they played team sports as a child. Describe two possible studies to test this theory. Design one as an observational study and the other as an experiment. Which is more practical?   Answer will vary. Here is one potential solution.  Observational: Survey adults who played sports as a child. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Record the percentage of each personality type.  Experimental: Survey adults and ask them if they played sports as children. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Compare the results of adults who played sports as children with the adults who didn’t play sports as children.  Which is more practical? The Experimental study would allow you to see if there is a significant difference in the personality types based on if the person played sports or didn’t play sports.    Find a newspaper or magazine article, or the online equivalent, describing the results of a recent study (not a simple poll). Give a summary of the study’s findings, then analyze whether the article provided enough information to determine the validity of the conclusions. If not, produce a list of things that are missing from the article that would help you determine the validity of the study. Look for the things discussed in the text: population, sample, randomness, blind, control, margin of error, etc.   Answers will vary depending on the article.    Use a polling website such as www.pewresearch.com or www.gallup.com and search for a poll that interests you. Find the result, the margin of error and confidence level for the poll and write the confidence interval.   Answers will vary depending on the poll being studied.    "

Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers.

  "body": " In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.

Retrieved 4\/27\/09 . This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn’t have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.     "

The raw data is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.     Types of Data  There are two types of data, categorical data and quantitative data.   Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the subjects into various categories.   We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that people saw in a movie theater. When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, Black Panther, Titanic, etc.   We can count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like Black Panther because it is categorical data.    Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful calculations.   A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). This would be quantitative data.   Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 110 minutes, etc.) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $9.75, $10.50, etc.).  We cannot assume that all numbers are quantitative data, and sometimes it is not so clear-cut. Here are some examples to illustrate this.      Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is \"twice\" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is \"twice\" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.    A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.   Overall, it is important to look at the purpose of the study for any variables that could be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Another consideration is what you plan to do with the data. Next, we will talk about how to display each type of data.    Presenting Categorical Data  Since we can’t do calculations with categorical data, we begin by summarizing the data in a frequency table or a relative frequency table.    Frequency Tables  A frequency table has one column for the categories, and another for the frequency , or number of times that category occurred.   An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in this table.     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions    Blue  25    Green  52    Red  41    White  36    Black  39    Grey  23    Total  216        Relative Frequency Tables  Numbers are usually not as easy to interpret as percentages, so we will add a column for the relative frequencies. A relative frequency is the percentage for the category, found by dividing each frequency by the total and converting to a percentage. You’ll notice the percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.    continued     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions  Relative Frequency of Total-Loss Collisions    Blue  25  or 11.6%    Green  52  or 24.1%    Red  41  or 19.0%    White  36  or 16.7%    Black  39  or 18.1%    Grey  23  or 10.7%    Total  216  or 100%     It would be even more useful to have a visual to see what is going on, and this is where charts and graphs come in. For categorical data we can display our data using bar graphs and pie charts.     Bar graphs  A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the height of the bar indicating the frequency of that category. To construct a bar graph with vertical bars, we label the horizontal axis with the categories. The vertical axis will have a scale for the frequency or relative frequency.   The highest frequency in our car data is 52 collisions, so we will set our vertical axis to go from 0 to 55, with a scale of 5 units. To draw bar graphs by hand graph paper is useful, or you can use technology. It is also very helpful to label each bar with the frequency or relative frequency.   This is a bar graph. Along the x-axis it lists: blue, green, red, white, black and grey. The x-axis is labeled “Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision.” The y-axis is labeled “frequency” and goes from 0 to 55 with a scale of 5. Above each color there is a bar corresponding to the frequency. Blue 25; Green 52; Red 41; White 36; Black 39; Grey 23.      Pie Charts  A natural way to visualize relative frequencies is with a pie chart. A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes like slices of pizza or pie. The size of each wedge corresponds to the relative frequency of the category. The slices add up to 100%, just like relative frequencies. Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies in the pie slices.   Pie charts look nice but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. A spreadsheet is much better suited to drawing pie charts.   A pie chart for the same data as the previous bar chart. The relative frequencies are given in each pie piece: Green 24%; Red 19%; Black 18%; White 17%; Blue 11%; Grey 11%.      Using a Spreadsheet to Make Bar Charts and Pie Charts  To make a graph using a spreadsheet, place the data from the frequency table into the cells. Then select the data, go to the Insert tab, and choose the bar graph or pie chart that you would like. For this example, we will choose a pie graph.    This is a large screen shot of excel that includes both the data and the Insert tab with various circle graph options.    After the spreadsheet has created your pie graph you can choose which design you prefer by clicking on the Chart Design tab. Since these pie pieces represent car colors, we matched the color of each wedge to the color of the car in our pie chart above.  To give your graph a meaningful title, click on Chart Title. There are many other settings that you can experiment with.    This is a screenshots of excel that shows the frequency table and pie chart and shows the Chart Design Tab.      Misleading Graphs  Graphs can be misleading intentionally or unintentionally. It’s better to keep them simple, clear and well-labeled. People sometimes add features to graphs that don’t help convey their information.    3-dimensional bar chart like the one shown is usually not as effective as a 2-dimensional graph. The extra dimension does not add any useful information.   A 3-D bar graph showing the car color data.    Here is another way that fanciness can sometimes lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.     Perceptual Distortion  A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the frequency or size of the values being represented. We need to be careful with these, because our brains perceive the relationship between the areas, not the heights.   A labor union might produce this graph to show the difference between the average manager salary and the average worker salary.   The average manager salary is twice as high as the average worker salary as in a bar graph, but the image is also twice as wide. That makes it look like the manager salary is 4 times as large as the worker salary. The area needs to accurately portray the relationship, otherwise we will have a perceptual distortion.   There are two bags of money shown. One is larger labeled Mananger Salaries. The other is half as tall and half as wide and labeled workers salaries. There are no numbers or scale shown.       Misleading Scale  Another type of distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.   Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December, 2008 CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation Poll. Dec 19-21, 2008, from http:\/\/www.pollingreport.com\/civil.htm . At a glance, the two graphs suggest very different stories. The second graph makes it look like more than three times as many people oppose marriage rights as support them. But when we look at the scale we can see that the difference is about 12%. By not starting at zero the difference looks enlarged.    A bar graph with a scale from 0-100%; There is a bar for support at about 44% and a bar for oppose at about 56%.    A bar graph of the same data but the scale goes from 40-60%; This magnifies the difference between the support and oppose groups.       Stacked Bar Graphs  Another type of graph that can be hard to read and sometimes misleading is a stacked bar graph. In a stacked bar graph , the values we are comparing are stacked on top of each other vertically.   The table lists college expenses for two different students and we want to compare them. A stacked bar graph shows the expenses stacked vertically, but we are interested in the differences, not the totals.     Expense  Student 1  Student 2    Rent  $500  $650    Food  $125  $125    Tuition  $1750  $1450    Books  $325  $275    Misc  $100  $175       A stacked bar graph with the bars for the expenses for student 2 placed on top of the bars for student 1.    A side-by-side bar graph with the bars for each student right next to each other.    It is much easier to interpret the differences in a side-by-side bar chart.     Presenting Quantitative Data  With categorical data, the horizontal axis is the category, but with quantitative, or numerical, data we have numbers. If we have repeated values we can also make a frequency table.   A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in their class. The scores are:  19, 20, 18, 18, 17, 18, 19, 17, 20, 18, 20, 16, 20, 15, 17, 12, 18, 19, 18, 19, 17, 20, 18, 16, 15, 18, 20, 5, 0 and 0.  Here is a frequency table with the scores grouped and put in order.     Quiz Score  Frequency of Students    0  2    5  1    12  1    15  2    16  2    17  4    18  8    19  4    20  6      Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for categorical data. However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart wouldn’t make sense; the first and second bars would be five values apart, while the later bars would only be one value apart. Instead, we will treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a histogram.    Histograms  A histogram is like a bar graph, but the horizontal axis is a number line. Unlike a bar graph, there are no spaces between the bars. Here are two histograms for the data given above. Notice that in the one on the left, the two scores of 15 are to the right of 15, or between 15 and 16. The horizontal scales on histograms can be confusing for this reason. Some people choose to have bars start at ½ values to avoid this ambiguity, as in the one on the right.    This is a histogram the x-axis is labeled score and goes from 0 to 21, with a scale of 1. The y-axis is labeled frequency an goes from 0 to 9 with a scale of 1. There are no spaces between the bars.    This is a histogram of the same data but this time the spaces are labeled 0 to 20 instead of the tick marks.    If we have a large number of different data values, a frequency table listing every possible value would be way too long. There would be too many bars on the histogram to reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.    Class Intervals   Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:   Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120-134, the second class should include values from 135-149.    We typically have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, depending on the number of data values we’re working with.     In the next example, we’ll make a histogram using class intervals.   Suppose we have collected weights from 100 subjects who identify as male, as part of a nutrition study. For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of .  There are many ways to draw a histogram and we will explain one way as an example. We will create 10 classes by doing the following calculation: Take the range of 142 and divide it by 10 to find the class width.     Then we round up the class width so that the largest data value will be in one of the classes. So we round up to a class width of 15. Since the minimum data value is 121, we will choose 120 to start with since it is a multiple of 15 that is less than 121.     Interval  Frequency    120-134  4    135-149  14    150-164  16    165-179  28    180-194  12    195-209  8    210-224  7    225-239  6    240-254  2    255-269  3     This is a histogram of the data in the table; the x-axis is labeled weights(pounds) and goes from 120 to 270, with a scale of 15; The y-axis is labeled frequency and goes from 0 to 30 with a scale of 5. There are no spaces between the bars.     When using class intervals, it is much easier to use technology that was specifically designed to make histograms. GeoGebra is one program that lets you adjust the class widths to see which graph best displays the data.    Histograms Using Technology  We will be using GeoGebra throughout this chapter to make graphs and calculate summary statistics. There is an online version and one you can download at www.Geogebra.org . To access the online version, select \"GeoGebra Classic from the GeoGebra home page. To download it, select \"App Downloads\" from the home page. The instructions are similar for both.   The first thing we need to do is enter the data in GeoGebra’s spreadsheet. You can access the spreadsheet from Main Menu View Spreadsheet. Next, enter your data and select that column. Then click on the histogram icon in the menu bar on the left side and select One Variable Analysis.   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis     A new window will pop up showing a visual of the data. There is a drop-down menu for the type of graph, but histogram is the default. Notice that the bars are not lined up with the tick-marks at the bottom, so we want to edit this histogram. The slider bar at the top will let you see different class widths, but we want to choose our class widths manually.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the histogram     If you close the menu at the top right by clicking on the left pointing triangle, you will see a settings wheel. Click on the wheel and check the box for set classes manually. To match our previous histogram, we will start at 120 pounds and set a class width of 15 pounds.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box checked for Set Classes Manually.     Now the bars of the histogram match our previous graph, but we need to edit the axis labels to match. Click on the graph tab on the right side and uncheck the box for automatic dimensions. We set the x min, x max, x step, y min, y max and y step as shown.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box uncheckd for Automatic Dimensions. The dimensions entered are xMin 111; xMax 275; xStep 15; yMin -3.4033; yMax: 30.8; yStep 5 (The y-dimensions were automatic)     To put the graph in an assignment or a book such as this one, select the export icon and choose Export as Picture. The downloaded version also has a Copy to Clipboard option. Then insert the graph into any document and add axis labels.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the export icon    Here is our finished histogram:    The finished histogram from GeoGebra copied into a Word document. This is the same histogram as in Example 10.      The Shape of a Distribution  Once we have our histogram, we can use it to determine the shape of the data or distribution . When describing distributions, we are going to look at four characteristics: shape, center, spread and outliers. Center and spread (variation) will be covered in the next two sections.    Modality  The modality of a distribution indicates the number of peaks or hills in its histogram.   It is unimodal if it has one peak.    It is bimodal if it has two peaks.    It is multimodal if it has multiple peaks.      The first graph is unimodal , the second is bimodal and the third is multimodal .    Three histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak. The second histograms has two peaks. The third histogram has three peaks.     A bimodal distribution can result when two different populations have been grouped together and they are overlapping. It would be better to separate them into two separate graphs. For example, the grams of sugar per serving in sugar and non-sugar cereals.    Symmetry  A distribution is symmetric if the left side of the graph mirrors the right side.   The graph on the left is symmetric and unimodal while the graph on the right is roughly symmetric and bimodal.    Two histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak in the middle and the bars taper down symmetrically on each side. The second histogram has two peaks. Each of the peaks are similar in size and the graph is roughly symmetric.       Skewness  If a distribution is not symmetric then we say it is skewed. A graph can be skewed to the left or skewed to the right . We say it is skewed in the direction of the longer tail.    Skewed to the Left  A left skewed graph is also called a negatively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the left or negative side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the right of center and the bars go down to the left gradually.      Skewed to the Right  A right skewed graph is also called a positively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the right or positive side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the left of center and the bars go down to the right gradually.      The Normal Distribution  The normal distribution has a very specific shape. It is unimodal and symmetric with a bell-shaped graph.         Outlier   Outliers are data values that are unusually far away from the rest of the data. There is often a gap between the outlier and the rest of the graph. This visual determination of outliers is often subjective and depends on the situation.    In the graph to the right we have a unimodal distribution that is skewed to the right. There appears to be an outlier near 20.   This distribution has majority of it's data on the left there is a gap in the graph with one bar further away.       Exercises   True or False: The bars of a histogram should always touch.   True    True or False: The bars of a bar graph should always touch.   False    Is the data described categorial or quantitative?   In a study, you ask the subjects their age in years.    In a study, you ask the subjects their gender.

In a study you ask the subjects the amount they spend on housing each month         Quantitative    Categorical    Quantitative    Quantitative    Quantitative       What types of graphs are used for categorical data?   Bar graphs and pie charts are used for categorical data.    What types of graphs are used for quantitative data?   Histograms are used for quantitative data.    A group of adults were asked how many children they have in their family. The bar graph to the right shows the number of adults who indicated each number of children.    A bar graph showing the frequency for amount of children: 0 kids 5; 2 kid 3; 2 kids 4; 3 kids 2; 4 kids 0; 5 kids 1.       How many adults had 3 children?    How many adults where questioned?    What percentage of the adults questioned had 0 children?         2 had 3 children.    15 adults were questioned.    33.33% of the adults questioned had 0 children.       Jasmine was interested in how many days it would take a DVD order from Netflix to arrive at her door. The graph shows the data she collected.    The x-axis is labeled shipping times (days) with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The y-axis is labeld frequency. The bar for 1 goes up to 4, 2 goes up to 8, 3 goes up to 6, there's no bar at 4 and 5 goes up to 1.       How many movies took 2 days to arrive?    How many movies did she order in total?    What percentage of the movies arrived in one day?         8 movies took 2 days to arrive.    She ordered 19 movies total.    21.05% of the movies arrived in one day.       This relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of students who received each letter grade on their last English paper. The class contains 20 students. What number of students earned an A on their paper?    There are 4 bars labeled A, B, C, and D. The x-axis is labeled grade on English paper and the y-axis is labeled frequency (%). A goes up to 25%, B goes up to 35%, C goes up to 25% and D goes up to 15%.     5 students earned and A on their paper.    This relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of each drink type served over the weekend at a local coffee shop. There were 120 drinks served in total. How many served drinks were lattes?    A relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of each type of coffee drink served over a weekend. For coffee, the relative frequency is 45%. For tea, the relative frequency is 15%. For latte, the relative frequency is 20%. For mocha, the relative frequency is 10%. For cappuccino, the relative frequency is 5%. For other, the relative frequency is 5%.     24 served drinks were lattes.    Corey categorized his spending for this month into four categories: Rent, Food, Fun, and Other. The percentages he spent in each category are pictured here. If he spent a total of $2,600 this month, how much did he spend on rent?    This is a pie chart with four regions. Fun is labeled 16%, Food is labeled 24%, Rent is labeled 26% and Other is labeled 34%.     Cory spent $676 on rent this month.    Jessica categorized the amount of time spent each week into 5 categories: Work, Travel, Housework, Leisure, and Sleep. If there are a total of 168 hours each week, how many hours does Habiba spend travelling each week?    This is a pie chart with five regions. Work is labled 29%, Travel is labeled 7%, Housework is labeled 12%, Leisure is labeled 23% and Sleep is labeled 29%.     Jessica spends 11.8 hours travelling each week.    In a survey Gallup Poll. March 5-8, 2009. http:\/\/www.pollingreport.com\/enviro.htm , 1012 adults were asked whether they personally worried about a variety of environmental concerns. The number of people who indicated that they worried a great deal about some selected concerns is listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a bar chart for this data.    Why can’t we make a pie chart for this data?        Environmenal Issue  Frequency    Pollution of drinking water  597    Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste  526    Air pollution  455    Global warming  354         This data is categorical.      There are four spaced apart bars labeled Pollution of drinking water, Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste, Air pollution, and Global warming. The x-axis is labeled Environmental Issue and the y-axis is labeled frequncy. Pollution of drinking water goes up to 597, Contamination of soil and drinking water goes up to 526, Air pollution goes up to 455, and Global warming goes up to 354.      No, we cannot make a pie chart out of this data. The total of the relative frequencies is 1932, but only 1012 adults were asked. So some adults selected multiple options.       In a survey, 2056 adults were asked about their views on immigration. The percent of people who responded that immigrants to the United States are making each of the following situations in the country better are listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency bar chart for this data.    Can we make a pie chart for this data?        Situation  Relative Frequency (%)    Food, music and the arts  57    The economy in general  43    Social and moral values  31    Job opportunities for you and your family  19    Taxes  20    Crime  7         This data is categorical.      There are six spaced apart bars labeled Food music and the arts, The economy in general, Social and moral values, Job opportunities for you and your family, Taxes, and Crime. The x-axis is labeled Situation and the y-axis is labeled Relative Frequency (%). Food music and the arts goes up to 57%, The economy in general goes up to 43%, Social and moral values goes up to 31%, Job opportunities for you and your family goes up to 19%, Taxes goes up to 20%, and Crime goes up to 7%.      No, we cannot make a pie chart out of this data. The relative frequencies add to 177%, which is more than 100%.       The following table is from a sample of five hundred homes in Oregon that were asked the primary source of heating in their home.   How many of the households heat their home with firewood?    What percent of households heat their home with natural gas?        Type of Heat  Relative Frequency (%)    Electricity  33    Heating Oil  4    Natural Gas  50    Firewood  8    Other  5         40 households heat their home with firewood.    50% of the households heat their home with natural gas.       The following table is from a sample of 50 undergraduate students at Portland State University.   What percent of the sampled students are below senior class?    How many of the sampled students are freshmen?

The x-axis is labeled Number of Cars, the scale goes from 0 to 6 and jumps by 1 unit. There are three bars, one from 0-2, one from 2-4, and one from 4-6. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 16 by units of two. The 0-2 bar goes to 7, the 2-4 bar goes to 14, and the 4-6 bar goes to 3.      This data is unimodal and skewed right, with no outliers.       The table below shows scores on a math test.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency table for the data using a class width of 10.    Construct a histogram of the data.     82  55  51  97  73  79  100  60  71  85  78  59    90  100  88  72  46  82  89  70  100  68  61  52            This is quantitative data.       Math Test Score  Frequency    40-49  1    50-59  4    60-69  3    70-79  6    80-89  5    90-99  2    100-109  3         The histogram is titled \"Histogram of math test scores\". The x-axis is labeled Scores, the scale goes from 40 to 110 and jumps by 10. There are seven bars, one from 40-50, one from 50-60, one from 60-70, one from 70-80, one from 80-90, one from 90-100, and one from 100-110. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 8 by two. The 40-50 bar goes to 1, the 50-60 bar goes to 4, the 60-70 bar goes to 3, the 70-80 bar goes to 6, the 80-90 bar goes to 5, the 90-100 bar goes to 2, and the 100-110 bar goes to 3.      The data is unimodal. There are no obvious outliers. The data is either symmetric or skewed left.       This graph shows the number of adults and kids who prefer each type of soda. There were 130 adults and kids surveyed. Discuss some ways in which the graph could be improved.    This is a 3 dimensional double bar graph. There is a bar for kids and a bar for adults. The x-axis is labeled coke, diet coke, sprite and cherry soda. The y-axis starts at 20 and goes to 45 with a scale of 5.     The graph would be more effective at displaying the true differences between the categories if the vertical scale started at 0. The vertical axis is missing a label and units, so we can’t tell if those are frequencies or relative frequencies. A flat bar graph (instead of the 3d graph) would be easier to read.    A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. Does this pie chart present a good representation of this data? Explain.    A pie chart with 4 regions: Nguyen is labeled 42%, McKee is labeled 35%, Jones is labeled 64% and Brown is labeled 52%.     No, this chart does not present a good representation of this data. The percentages in a pie chart must add to 100%, but these add to 193%. A bar chart would be appropriate for this data.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Favorite Drinks\". The x-axis is labeled Drink Type and includes colas, lemon flavored, root beer, teas, coffee, and other. The y-axis is labeled frequency and has no scale.     This is a poor graph because the vertical axis does not have a numerical scale, so we cannot know how many have each drink as a favorite drink. We also don’t know if the bottom vertical line represents 0, which is potentially misleading.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Profit During First Half of Year\". The x-axis is labeled Year and includes January, February, March, April, May, and June. The y-axis is labeled Profits in $. The scale goes from 0 to 4500 by 500. The bar for each month is labeled with the following values: January 4230, February 3760, March 2670, April -1320, May 750, and June 1560. The bar for April is colored red while the remaining bars are colored blue.     2This is a misleading graph because the $-1320 in April represents a loss (instead of a profit), but the height of the bar for April looks like a profit. Also, the horizontal axis label is Year , but the bar labels are months.    Match each description to one of the graphs.   Normal distribution    Positive or right skewed    Negative or left skewed    Bimodal       The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.   This histogram has a tall bar on the left side, then the bars decrease significantly and then increase for a peak on the right side.     Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.   This histogram has shorter bars to the left, which gradually get taller. The tallest bar is on the right side of the graph.       The distribution of scores on a psychology test.   This histogram increases sharply and then decreases gradually. The peak is just to the left of the center.     The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.   This histogram is symmetric. The highest bar is in the middle and the bars decrease in height as you move away from the middle.         Normal distribution – The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.    Positive or right skewed – Distribution of scores on a psychology test.    Negative or left skewed – Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.    Bimodal – The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.       Write a sentence or two to describe each distribution in terms of modality, symmetry, skewness and outliers.      This histogram has the tallest bars on the left side and then decreases to the right.      The bars in this histogram increase gradually to the center and then decrease. The bars drop off slightly faster to the right.        The bars in this histogram increase sharply to the tallest bars on the left side, then decrease and increase to the second tallest bar, then decrease again to the right.      The bars on this histogram start out at a middle height and then go down and up in a U shape to the tallest bar to the right of center. Then the bars decrease and increase again for another tall bar on the right.      The bars on this histogram gradually increase to the right and drop of quickly after the peak toward the right side of the graph.          This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There is a possible outlier between 10 and 11.    This distribution is unimodal and symmetric. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There are no obvious outliers.    This distribution is multimodal and left skewed. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and left skewed. There are no obvious outliers.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.   Create a histogram for each dataset, using the same class intervals and scales so you can compare them.    Compare and contrast the two distributions.  Researcher 1: 3, 4, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22, 44, 37, 16, 14, 24, 25, 15, 26, 27, 33, 29, 35, 44, 13, 21, 22, 10, 12, 8, 40, 32, 26, 27, 31, 34, 29, 17, 8, 24, 18, 47, 33, 34  Researcher 2: 3, 14, 11, 5, 16, 17, 28, 41, 31, 18, 14, 14, 26, 25, 21, 22, 31, 2, 35, 44, 23, 21, 21, 16, 12, 18, 41, 22, 16, 25, 33, 34, 29, 13, 18, 24, 23, 42, 33, 29                     The data for patients of both researchers is symmetric. Researcher’s 1 patients’ data appears to be unimodal, but Researcher 2’s patients’ data may be bimodal or multimodal. The data for Researcher 1’s patients does not have any outliers, but the data for Researcher’s 2 may have outliers between 0 and 5 months or 40 and 45 months.       "

A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Center   Summary Statistics: Measures of Center   Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of center: mean and median    Analyze the relationship of the mean and median to the shape of the data       Calculating Summary Statistics  In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numbers to summarize quantitative distributions. We want to know what an average value is (where the data is centered), and how spread out the values are. Together, the center and spread provide important information which can be used to estimate our population parameters. In this section we will discuss the measures of center and in the next section we will discuss the measures of spread.    Measures of Center  There are a few different types of averages that measure the center, and the one we use will depend on the shape of the distribution. We will mention the mode but focus mainly on the two most common averages : the mean and the median .    Mode  In the previous section, we saw that the modes are related to the peaks where similar values are grouped. The mode is the value with the highest frequency (A mode is the value where a peak occurs. One additional way to calculate the mode(s) is to take the midpoint of each peak in the histogram.)    Mean  The mean , or more formally the arithmetic mean, is what probably comes to mind when you hear the word average. The calculation of the mean uses every data value in the distribution and is therefore strongly affected by skew and outliers.  To calculate the mean of a distribution, we divide the sum of the data values by the number of data values we have. The sample mean is usually represented by, a lower-case with a bar over it, read-bar. The lower-case letter n is used to represent the number of data values or sample size .   Mean        Mirabel’s exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. What is her mean test score?    To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores ( ). The mean is:   points  We will round the sample mean to one more decimal place than the original data. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3 points. Also notice that the mean has the same units as the data and it is important to label it.    It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when the data set is small, but if the data set is large, or if you will be finding additional statistics, then technology is the way to go. We can find the mean of a data set using the spreadsheet formula =AVERAGE .   The price of peanut butter at 5 stores was $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the mean price using a spreadsheet. There are two ways to use the =AVERAGE formula. If your data set is not too large, you can enter each value directly into the formula. Using this method, we write   =AVERAGE(3.29 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the values.    and we get an answer of $3.68.  The other method is to enter the data values into a single column (or row) of the spreadsheet and reference the column (or row) range in the formula. We can enter the range by highlighting the data values. As illustrated below, if we enter the data into column A, the formula is   =AVERAGE(A1:A5)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in column A    and we also get an answer of $3.68.   Sometimes when there is a lot of data with repeated values we are given a frequency table.   One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below.     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    $15  6    $20  8    $25  11    $30  17    $35  19    $40  20    $45  12    $50  7     Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:     We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as . Using this simplification, we get     The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.   We could also use =AVERAGE to find the mean for this example, but it would require entering each repeated value individually. If the mean is all we need, then taking advantage of multiplication as repeated addition is the more straightforward way to go. We could also enter the frequency table and the calculation above in a spreadsheet.   Extending the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood and has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our mean becomes:     While 83.1 thousand dollars, or $83,100 is the correct mean household income for the new sample, it is no longer representative of the neighborhood – in fact, it is greater than every income in the sample aside from the new one we added!   Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value at the tip of the triangle that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.    A drawing of a see-saw with rectangles to indicate the data values. Most of the data values are to the left of the fulcrum; the two values to the right are spread out which causes the data to be balanced.    If we graph our household data, the $5 million value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust to keep things in balance.    With the outlier data value added, the see-saw is extended with that value far to the right. Now all of the original data values are to the left of the fulcrum.    For this reason, when working with data that is skewed or has outliers, it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.    Median  The median of a data set is the middle value, when the data are listed in order from smallest to largest. We can also think of the median as the value that has 50% of the data below it and 50% of data above it. As we will discover later, the median is also the 50th percentile .   Median  If the number of data values is odd, then the median is the middle data value If the number of data values is even, then the median is the mean of the middle pair    When finding the median of an odd number of values.  Use the following quiz scores: 5, 10, 8, 6, 4, 8, 2, 5, 7, 7, 6  We must start by listing the data in order: 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10.  It is helpful to mark or cross off the numbers as you list them to make sure you don’t miss any. Also, be sure to count the number of data values in your ordered list to make sure it matches the number of data values in the original list.  In this example there are 11 quiz scores. When the distribution contains an odd number of data values there will be a single number in the middle and that is the median. For small data sets, we can “walk” one value at a time from the ends of the ordered list towards the center to find the median     The median test score is 6 points.    When finding the median of an even number of values.  Use the following quiz scores: 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 20.  There are now 12 quiz scores in our sample. When the distribution contains an even number of data values there will be a pair of values in the middle rather than a single value. Then we take the average of the middle two values.     Median points  What is important to notice is that despite adding an outlier to our data set, the median is largely unaffected. The median quiz score for the new distribution is 6.5 points.  We can also find the median using the spreadsheet formula =MEDIAN . Just like the spreadsheet function =AVERAGE , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row (or column) and use the row range (or column range) in the formula.  Using the data values of the original distribution, we can write function as   =MEDIAN(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10) or   =MEDIAN(A1:AK)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in row 1    and we get 6 points for the median test score.    Let’s continue with our peanut butter example and find the median both by hand and with a spreadsheet. The price of peanut butter at 5 stores was $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99.  To find the median by hand, we must first list the prices in order. This give us: $3.29, $3.59, $3.75, $3.79, $3.99  Since there are an odd number of data values in the sample ( ), we know that the median will be the single data value in the middle of the ordered list.     The median price of peanut butter at these five stores is $3.75.  Using a spreadsheet, we write   =MEDIAN(3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula with all the data values typed in.    and we get a median price of $3.75.   It is worth noting that when you use a spreadsheet to find the median you do not have to order the data first. You can enter the data values in the order they are given to you.    The Relationship Between the Mean and the Median  If a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, as we saw in the see-saw diagram. In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, while in a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. If the distribution is symmetric, the mean and the median will be approximately equal.  To demonstrate this, we have entered some data in GeoGebra, as previously explained, and made histograms. To see the statistics that GeoGebra calculates, we click on the summation symbol on the right-hand menu bar.   Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.  From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.   Mean , Median , Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the right. The statistics output shows the mean is $67,160 and the Median is $53,500.      A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points   Mean points, Median points, Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the left. The statistics output shows the mean is 81.7 points and the Median is 87.5 points.      Nineteen people identifying as female were sampled and their heights (in inches) were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and roughly symmetric. We can also see from the statistics output that the mean and the median are approximately equal. inches inches   Mean inches, Median inches Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is approximately symmetric. The statistics output shows the mean is 62.6 inches and the Median is 62 inches.     We can use these observations in reverse as well. If we know the mean is greater than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right. If the mean is less than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the left. When the mean and the median are approximately equal, the distribution is likely to be symmetric.    Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Just based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?    Since the mean is greater than the median, we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.      Exercises   A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a meal.

The sum of the frequencies is 34, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 34 values (an even number), we know that the median will be the mean of the two middle values. Because , we know the two middle values are the 17th and 18th values. The 17th value is 4, and the 18th value is 5, so the median is 4.5 thousand characters.    Since the mean is greater than the median, we expect the distribution to be skewed right.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.     Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.     Researcher 1: 3, 4, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22, 44, 37, 16, 14, 24, 25, 15, 26, 27, 33, 29, 35, 44, 13, 21, 22, 10, 12, 8, 40, 32, 26, 27, 31, 34, 29, 17, 8, 24, 18, 47, 33, 34    Researcher 2: 3, 14, 11, 5, 16, 17, 28, 41, 31, 18, 14, 14, 26, 25, 21, 22, 31, 2, 35, 44, 23, 21, 21, 16, 12, 18, 41, 22, 16, 25, 33, 34, 29, 13, 18, 24, 23, 42, 33, 29 5.            For Researcher 1:  In Excel:   =average(3,4,11,15,16,17,22,44,37,16,14,24,25,15,26,27,33,29,35,44,13,21,22,10,12,8,40,32,26,27,31,34,29,17,8,24,18,47,33,34)    months.   =median(3,4,11,15,16,17,22,44,37,16,14,24,25,15,26,27,33,29,35,44,13,21,22,10,12,8,40,32,26,27,31,34,29,17,8,24,18,47,33,34)    months  The mean for Researcher 1’s patients is 23.6 months, and the median for Researcher’s 1 patients is 24 months.  For Researcher 2:  In Excel:   =average(3,14,11,5,16,17,28,41,31,18,14,14,26,25,21,22,31,2,35,44,23,21,21,16,12,18,41,22,16,25,33,34,29,13,18,24,23,42,33,29)    months   =median(3,14,11,5,16,17,28,41,31,18,14,14,26,25,21,22,31,2,35,44,23,21,21,16,12,18,41,22,16,25,33,34,29,13,18,24,23,42,33,29)    months  The mean for Researcher 2’s patients is 22.8 months, and the median is 22 months    Both the mean and median for Researcher 1’s patients are greater than the mean and median for Researcher 2’s patients. So, on average, Researcher 1’s patients have a longer life time after starting the cancer treatment than Researcher 2’s patients.       The US Census Bureau, in addition to counting the population of the US every 10 years, conducts yearly informational surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS). For the 2012 ACS, a randomly chosen group of 20 respondents (10 males, 10 females) answered a question about their incomes. Data from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.1 Exercise #1. ( https:\/\/www.openintro.org\/stat\/textbook.php?stat_book=aps ).      Males: $53,000; $70,000; $12,800; 30,000; $4,500; $42,000; $48,000; $60,000; $108,000; $11,000    Females: $1,600; $1,200; $20,000; $25,000; $670; $29,000; $44,000; $30,000; $5,800; $50,000        Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.         For Males:  In Excel   =average(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)       =median(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)      The mean for males is $43,930, and the median for males is $45,000.  For Females:   =average(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)       =median(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)      The mean for females is $20,727, and the median for females is $22,500    Both the mean income and median income for the males in the sample were twice as large as the mean income and median income for the females in the sample. The difference between the mean and median income for the females was slightly larger than the mean and median income for the males, so the distribution of incomes for the females is possibly more skewed than the distribution for the males.       An experiment compared the ability of three groups of participants to remember briefly-presented chess positions. The data are shown below. The numbers represent the average number of pieces correctly remembered from three chess positions.   Make a histogram for each group.    Find the mean of each group.

Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Non-players     Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Beginners      Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Tournament Players       The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.65 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 47.6 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 64.98 pieces.    The median number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.5 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 51.3 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 71.1 pieces.    The distribution for non-players appears to be uniform. The distribution for beginners looks unimodal and left-skewed. The distribution for tournament players appears bimodal and symmetric.  The mean and median number of pieces correctly remembered were both greatest for tournament players, with non-players having the smallest mean and median of pieces correctly remembered.       There is evidence that smiling can attenuate judgments of possible wrongdoing. This phenomenon termed the \"smile-leniency effect\" was the focus of a study by Marianne LaFrance & Marvin Hecht in 1995 LaFrance, M., & Hecht, M. A. (1995) Why smiles generate leniency. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 207-214. Adapted from www.onlinestatbook.com , by David M. Lane, et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . The following data are measurements of how lenient the sentences were for three different types of smiles and one neutral control. A higher number indicates greater leniency. The same subject was used for all of the conditions so that may affect the results.   Make a histogram for each smile type and the neutral control.    Find the mean for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Find the median for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Compare the shapes of the distributions as well as the centers for each type of smile and control.

The mean leniency for the felt smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the neutral control group was 4.1.    The median leniency for the false smile group was 5.5.  The median leniency for the felt smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the neutral control group was 4.0.    Answers will vary depending on the graphs created. The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4       Make up three data sets with 5 values each that have:   The same mean but different medians    The same median but different means.         There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values each that have the same mean but different medians are:     0,  0,  0,  0,  10    0,  0,  2,  4,  4    0,  1,  1,  1,  7       There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values that have the same median but different means are:     10,  10,  10,  10,  10    0,  0,  10,  15,  20    1,  5,  10,  10,  10          The frequency table below shows the number of women’s shoes that were sold in an hour at a local shoe store.     Would you treat this data as categorical or quantitative?    How would the bar graph be different from the histogram?    Treat the data as quantitative and find the mean and the median. Are these useful statistics?     Shoe Size  Frequency    5  4    6  4    7  6    8  6    9  5            Argument for categorical: Because it is not clear that the shoe sizes represent a measure, the data can be considered categorical.  Argument for quantitative: Because shoe size is a measurement that corresponds to the length of someone’s foot, it can be treated as quantitative data.    Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.    The mean shoe size to be 7.2 and the median shoe size to be 7.  The mean shoe size is:     Since there are 25 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 13th value in the list. The 13th value is 7, so the median shoe size is 7.  The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)       At the end of the term, 400 students take a final exam, and their scores (as percentages) are plotted in a histogram.

Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is skewed left.    I expect that the mean is less than the median because the graph is skewed left.

Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed right, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is symmetric. The graph has a single peak between $65,000 an $66,000, and there are approximately an equal number of data values on either side of this peak.    I expect that the mean and median are equal because the graph is symmetric.       For each of the following distributions, would you expect that the mean is less than the median, less than the median, or equal to the median? Explain your reasoning.

The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4     "

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of variation: standard deviation, range and interquartile range (IQR)    Calculate the 5-number summary and construct boxplots by hand and\/or using technology (boxplots using technology may be modified or not)    Compare distributions with side-by-side boxplots and percentiles    Calculate and apply Z-scores       Measures of Variation  Consider these three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz:  Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10  Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6  All three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.  Thus, in addition to the mean and median, which are measures of center or the average value, we also need a measure of how spread out \" or varied each data set is.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the standard deviation , range and the interquartile range (IQR) .    Standard Deviation  The sample standard deviation, s , is a measure of variation that tells us how far, on average, the data values deviate, or are different from, the mean. The mean and standard deviation are paired to provide a measure of center and spread for symmetric distributions.   Sample Standard Deviation     where is the sample size, or the number of data values   We will go through the whole process for calculating the standard deviation. Let’s say there is another section of quiz scores:  Section D: 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10  The mean quiz score, like Sections A, B and C, is 5 points.  The first step in finding the standard deviation is to find the deviation, or difference, of each data value from the mean. We will do this in a table. You could also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.     Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10      We would like to get an idea of the average deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column, the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square the deviations.     Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)  Deviation Squared    0      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      10       Next, we add the squared deviations and we get     Ordinarily, we would then divide by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations, but the division by is only done if the data set represents a population. When the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we divide by (in this case,).  We assume Section D represents a sample, so we will divide by 9. Note that our units are now points-squared since we squared all of the deviations. It is much more meaningful to use the units we started with, so to convert back to points we take the square root.  The sample standard deviation for Section D is     For comparison, here is the standard deviation for each section listed above:   points   points   points   points  For the standard deviation, we usually use two more decimal places than the original data. This tells us that on average, scores were 2.36 points away from the mean of 5 points. In summary, here are the steps to calculate the standard deviation by hand.   Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation     Find the deviations by subtracting the mean from each data value    Square each deviation    Add the squared deviations    Compute the square root of the sum by dividing by :         There are a few important characteristics we want to keep in mind when finding and interpreting the standard deviation.   The standard deviation is never negative. It will be zero if all the data values are equal and get larger as the data spreads out.    The standard deviation has the same units as the original data and it is important to label it.    The standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.      To continue our peanut butter example, we will find the standard deviation of this sample: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99.  The first thing we need to find is the sample mean, and we know it is $3.68 from our previous work. Next, we need to find the deviation from the mean for each data value and square it.     Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared    $3.29      $3.59      $3.79      $3.75      $3.99       The sum of the deviations squared is     The sample standard deviation is     Since the units are dollars, we will round to two decimal places rather than two more than the data. This gives us a standard deviation of $0.26. Together with the mean this tells us that on average, the cost of a jar of peanut butter is $0.26 away from the mean of $3.68.   Calculating the standard deviation by hand can be quite a nuisance when we are dealing with a large data set, so we can also use technology. We use the spreadsheet function =STDEV.S to find the sample standard deviation. Notice that this is different from the population standard deviation, which uses the function =STDEV.P .  Just like the spreadsheet functions =AVERAGE and =MEDIAN , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row or column and use the row or column range in the formula.    The total cost of textbooks for the term was collected from 36 students. Use a spreadsheet to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the sample.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250  $260 $280 $285 $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305  $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320 $330 $340 $345  $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460  Since we are finding more than one statistic for this data set, it is much more efficient to enter the data values into a row or column and reference the range in each of the formulas. We enter the data into column A.     For the mean we enter: =AVERAGE(A1:A36) and get a result of $299.58.  For the median we enter: =MEDIAN(A1:A36) and get a result of $307.50.  For the standard deviation we enter: =STDEV.S(A1:A36) and get $78.68.   The mean and the median are relatively close to each other, so we can expect the distribution to be approximately symmetric with maybe a slight skew to the left, since the mean is smaller. The mean and standard deviation together tell us that the average cost of textbooks for a term is about $299.58, give or take $78.68.    In addition to a spreadsheet, we will continue our use of GeoGebra. Let’s take a look at how to use GeoGeogebra to find the mean, median and standard deviation for the last example. We begin just like we did for making a histogram.    continued: We enter the textbook data into column A of the spreadsheet in GeoGebra. (Main Menu →View →Spreadsheet). Next, select the column title of your data, click on the histogram in the menu bar on the left, and select One Variable Analysis.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis    Then you will see the histogram. It is always a good idea to check the shape of your distribution before calculating anything. Notice our histogram matches what we found about the distribution from the mean and median. It is approximately symmetric or slightly skewed to the left.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram. The summation symbol to show summary statistics is on the right side.    Next, we click the summation symbol in the menu bar on the right. The list of summary statistics will pop up as you can see in the image below. We see that the mean is $299.58, the median is $307.50 and the sample standard deviation is $78.68 – just like we found using the spreadsheet formulas.  The statistics we will use are the sample size , the mean, median, and the sample standard deviation . The last five entries in the table – min, Q1, median, Q3, and max – together make up the 5-number summary which we will learn about shortly!    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data, histogram and summary statistics.    The standard deviation is the measure of variation that we pair with the mean for approximately symmetric distributions. This pairing should make sense because the standard deviation uses the mean in its calculation. But what about the median? What measure of variation do we pair with it?     Range  One candidate is the range . The range tells us the spread or width of the entire data set. We calculate the range as the difference between the maximum and minimum value.   Range      However, the range is not a very good measure of variation since it is very strongly affected by skew and outliers. Consider, for example, the distribution of full time salaries in the United States. Many people earn a minimum wage salary, while others like Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Bill Gates (Microsoft) earn millions (if not billions!). A range this large does very little to help us get a sense of the spread where most of the data values lie.    Quartiles and the Interquartile Range  Instead, the measure of variation that we pair with the median is the interquartile range (IQR) . The IQR tells us the width of the middle 50% of data values. By cutting off the lower and upper 25% of data values, we are able to ignore extreme values and provide a more accurate sense of how spread out the distribution is.  The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Before we can calculate the interquartile range, though, we need to learn how to find the first and third quartiles.   Interquartile Range (IQR)      As the name implies, quartiles are values that divide the data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the value that 25% of the data lie below. The third quartile (Q3) is the value that 75% of the data lie below. As you might have guessed, the second quartile is the same as the median since 50% of the data values lie below it.  We have seen that the data is split in half by the median so to split it into quarters, we find the median of each half of the data.   Quartiles   the median of the lower half of the data   is the median of the whole data set   is the median of the upper half of the data  If there is an odd number of data values, we don’t use the median in either half     (even number of data values): Suppose we have measured the height, in inches, of 12 people who identify as female. The data values are listed below. Find the interquartile range.  59 60 69 64 70 72 66 64 67 66 63 61    Just like when finding the median, we must first order the data.  59 60 61 63 64 64 66 66 67 69 70 72  Then we divide the data into two halves. In the case of an even sample size, we split the distribution down the middle. The first 6 data values are the lower half and the next 6 data values are the upper half. Then we find the median of each. The median of the lower half is Q1 and the median of the upper half is Q3.     In this data inches, and inches. Then we subtract to find the IQR.     This tells us the that the middle 50% of the women’s heights lie within an interval of 6 inches.     (odd number of data values): Suppose we added one more height (68 inches) to the data set from the previous example. We will again find the interquartile range of the heights.  59 60 61 63 64 64 66 66 67 68 69 70 72  The data are already in order, but we have an odd number of values. To deal with this we do not use the median in the upper or lower halves. The lower half will include the values strictly below the median, and the upper half will include the values strictly above the median.     Then the interquartile range is:     If the data set is small, we can find the first and third quartiles by hand, but we have also seen that they are part of the output from GeoGebra. Here is the output for this data.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    From the list of summary statistics we can see that and inches. Now we can calculate the interquartile range.      This is the same value we found by hand. It is important to note that we are not using spreadsheets for the five-number summary because they do not calculate the quartiles in the same way, so they will not give the same results. Now that we have learned how to find the quartiles we can make a five-number summary and boxplot.    The Five-Number Summary and Boxplots  The five-number summary is made up of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and the maximum. These five values divide the data into quarters. A boxplot , also called a box-and-whisker plot , is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. Each region of the boxplot contains approximately the same number of data values, so we can see the spread for each region. We can find the five-number summary and draw a boxplot by hand or by using GeoGebra. In our last example the five-number summary from GeoGebra is: 59, 62, 66, 68.5, 72 inches.   Five-Number Summary      We will use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for the next example and then explain how to draw a boxplot.    Let’s continue with the cost of textbook data from . Use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for this sample and draw a boxplot by hand.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250  $260 $280 $285 $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305  $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320 $330 $340 $345  $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460    As we found before, here is the GeoGebra output. The last five entries of the summary statistics are the five-number summary. Remember to label all of your statistics with units.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    The five-number summary is     Min   Median   Max    $140  $255  $307.50  $347.50  $460     To draw the boxplot, we will first draw a number line that extends a little beyond the minimum and maximum values, and choose a scale. We decided to draw our number line from $120 to $480, in increments of $40. Then we add a meaningful title and units.  Next, make vertical lines at the first quartile, median and third quartile and connect them to form a box. This is the middle 50% of the data and you might notice that the width of the box is the IQR. Then, extend the whiskers out to the minimum and maximum values. Note that a boxplot does not have a vertical scale and the height of the box does not matter. Our boxplot looks like this:    A boxplot with a horizontal scale from $120 to $480 with a scale of $40.    GeoGebra will also draw boxplots for us. We enter and select the data values like we have done before and select One Variable Statistics. This brings up the graphics window with a histogram by default. Use the drop-down menu to select the boxplot. We also click on to show the summary statistics.      We will continue with our height data from the 12 people who identify as women. Find the five-number summary and create a boxplot using GeoGebra.    59 60 69 64 70 72 66 64 67 66 63 61  Following the steps above we have the following GeoGebra output. The last five entries in the statistics table are the five-number summary and we have the boxplot on the right.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showint the data, summary statistics and the boxplot.    Here is the five-number summary:     Min   Median   Max    59in  62in  65in  68in  72in     For this data, the two sides of the box and the two whiskers are approximately the same width. This suggests that the distribution is symmetric. We can verify this by noticing that the mean is approximately equal to the median.  The boxplot can tell us the shape of the distribution, but we cannot tell how many peaks the data has. For that we need a histogram. We can see the histogram and boxplot together by selecting the icon that looks like two rectangles stacked, or an = sign.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram and boxplot stacked.    Now we have a full picture of this data.    The default boxplot in GeoGebra is called a modified box plot , which shows the data values that are outliers with an X but requires a few more steps to make by hand. To change from the modified box plot to a regular box plot, click on the left pointing arrow in the boxplot window (downloaded version) or the settings wheel (online version) for options, and uncheck “show outliers.” The output window below shows two side-by-side boxplots (the regular boxplot on top and the modified boxplot on the bottom) illustrating the distribution of the annual salaries for 50 randomly selected full-time workers in the Portland Metro area.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing two boxplots for the same data stacked. The first one is the regular boxplot and show outliers is unchecked; the second one has 4 outliers on the right side and the box for show outliers is checked.    From the upper boxplot we can see that this distribution is skewed to the right and the upper quarter of the data is very spread out. It is natural to think of the data values as being evenly spread out in each region, but that is quite often not the case. From the lower boxplot we can see that there are 4 data values that are considered outliers and how far away the last data value is from the others. This is why it is useful to show outliers on a boxplot.    Modified Boxplot (Optional)  If you are curious to know how a modified boxplot is made, we will explain it briefly. There is a rule called the 1.5*IQR rule to determine which points are considered outliers. An outlier is a point that is more than 1.5 IQRs away from the middle 50% of the data (the box in the boxplot). We know how to calculate the IQR and then we multiply that by 1.5. We subtract that from Q1 to find the lower fence and add that value to Q3 to find the upper fence . Values beyond the fences are considered outliers and are drawn with an X or a star. Then we draw the whiskers of a modified box plot to the furthest data value inside the fence on each side.    Percentiles  Back when we were finding the median, we mentioned that the median is also called the 50th percentile, because 50% of the data values lie below it. We can define any percentile as the data value with that percentage of values below it. Since we have found the quartiles, we can also identify the 25th and 75th percentiles for our data. Q1 is the 25th percentile because 25% of the data values lie below it and Q3 is the 75th percentile because 75% of the data values lie below it.  Percentiles are used when comparing the growth of children to the population and in the results of standardized tests, such as the SAT test. If a person scored in the 83rd percentile, that means they scored higher than 83% of the people who took the test.    Comparing Distributions  Box plots and percentiles are particularly useful for comparing data from two populations.    The box plots of service times for two fast-food restaurants are shown below. Compare the length of time to get served at the two restaurants. Which one should you go to if you are in a hurry?    The boxplot for Store 1 shows a 5-number summary of 0.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.9, 6.3 minutes. The boxplot for Store 2 shows a 5-number summary of 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 5.7, 9.6 minutes.      Store 2 has a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), but the service times are less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.  The 75th percentiles are 2.9 and 5.7 minutes. That means at store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.  Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinion about luck – 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.      The boxplots below show the 5-number summaries of the birth weights, in kilograms, of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS) van Vliet, P.K. and Gupta, J.M. (1973) Sodium bicarbonate in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. Arch. Disease in Childhood, 48, 249–255. As quoted on http:\/\/openlearn.open.ac.uk\/mod\/oucontent\/view.php?id=398296&section=1.1.3 . The boxplots are separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not. What can we conclude from this data?    The boxplot for infants who survived shows a 5-number summary of approximately 1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.9, 3.7 kg. The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.      Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died. Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.      Z-Scores  Have you ever heard the saying that you can’t compare apples and oranges? It turns out that you can - provided we standardize their measures first!  We will be using the standard score called a Z-score, which is a method commonly used with unimodal and symmetric distributions (called normal or nearly normal distributions ). Z-scores may be used with any data, but if the distribution is skewed, then the distribution of Z-scores will also be skewed.  To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we find out how far away from the mean it is by subtracting. Then we divide by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide   If a data value is above the mean, its Z-score will be positive. If a data value is below the mean, its Z-score will be negative. Therefore, if a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is +1. If it is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, its Z-score is -2.5. Note that the units of Z-scores are standard deviations, not the units of the data values.  We can use Z-scores to determine the relative unusualness of a data value with respect to its own distribution. That is what allows us to compare two unlike items. The convention in statistics is to say that a data value is unusual if it is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, or in other words, if its Z-score is less than -2 or greater than +2.   The oranges at a local grocery store have a mean diameter of 5.8 inches and a standard deviation of 1.2 inches. The apples, on the other hand, have a mean diameter of 4.2 inches and a standard deviation of 0.6 inches.  Ali closes their eyes and selects and apple and an orange. When they look at both pieces of fruit, they seem small. If the orange has a diameter of 4.2 inches and the apple has a diameter of 3.5 inches, which is smaller relative to their respective piles of fruit?  To determine which fruit is relatively smaller, Ali can find each of their Z-scores.     By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple’s Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.     Orange: =STANDARDIZE (3.5, 4.2, 0.6) and we get -1.17 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.      The mean weight of men over the age of 20 is 195.7 pounds 2016 CDC Report. https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/data\/series\/sr_03\/sr03_039.pdf . The study included all ethnicities but the report does not say whether transgendered men were included. with a standard deviation of 29.8 pounds. The mean weight of domestic cats is 8.6 pounds with a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. (The standard deviation for men’s weights is estimated. The cat’s mean weight is based on ideal cat weight and the standard deviation is approximate).  At his peak, Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch French professional wrestler and actor, weighed 520 pounds. When Georgie the cat was at his peak he weighed 24 pounds. Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie’s weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.     Exercises    A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a meal.

Estimate the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for CPA and actuary salaries.    Deshawn makes the median salary for an actuary. Kelsey makes the first quartile salary for a CPA. Who makes more money? How much more?    What percentage of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA?    What percentage of CPAs earn less than all actuaries?    The boxplot for CPA salary shows a 5-number summary of 30, 40, 75, 90, 100 in thousand dollars. The boxplot for Actuary salary shows a 5-number summary of 40, 75, 90, 94, 110 in thousand dollars           The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are, respectively, the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile for the data sets. Reading the boxplot for CPAs, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for CPAs’ salaries are, respectively, $40,000, $75,000, and $90,000. Reading the boxplot for actuaries, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for actuaries’ salaries are, respectively, $75,000, $90,000, and $94,000    Deshawn’s salary (the median salary for an actuary) is $90,000; Kelsey’s salary (the first quartile salary) is also $75,000. So Deshawn makes more than Kelsey, by $15,000.    75% of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA ($75,000).    25% of all CPAs earn less than all actuaries.       Fifty juniors and fifty seniors at a local high school were surveyed to find out how many hours per week they spend studying.

The boxplot of weekly study time for juniors shows a 5-number summary of 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 hours       Estimate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study time for high school juniors and seniors.    Olivia studies the maximum number of weekly study hours for a junior. Lucy studies the first quartile weekly study time for a senior. Who studies more, and by how many hours?    What percentage of juniors study between the minimum and median weekly study times for seniors?    What percentage of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times for the juniors are 1 hour, 3 hours, and 4 hours, respectively. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times the seniors are 5.5 hours, 6 hours, and 9 hours.    Olivia studies more each week than Lucy, by 30 minutes.    50% of juniors study between the minimum and median number of hours for seniors.    100% of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 25 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 21.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation of gas mileage for cars of that model is 1.15 mpg.   Find the Z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your Z-score.              The -score for the gas mileage of the car is -3.13 standard deviations.       According to a local marathon club, the mean finishing time for a marathon is 274 minutes, with a standard deviation of 63 minutes.     If I can run a marathon with a finishing time of 170 minutes, find the Z-score for my marathon time.    Is my marathon finishing time of 170 minutes unusually fast? Explain your answer using the Z-score.            The marathon time’s -score is -1.65 standard deviations.    Because the marathon finishing time is within 2 standard deviations of the mean finishing time, no, this marathon finishing time is not usually fast.       This data is a sample of the average number of hours per year that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 11 cities: 56, 53, 53, 50, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42,40, 36   Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 46.2 hours per year, and the standard deviation is 6.16 hours per year.       The -score for a city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year is -0.68 standard deviations.       In a survey of 12 companies recruiting for recent college graduates, they reported the following numbers of job applicants per job posting: 123, 123, 134, 127, 115, 122, 125, 101, 130, 143, 110, and 122.     Find the mean and standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z score for the company with 143 job applicants per job posting?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 122.9 job applicants per job posting, and the standard deviation is 10.91 job applicants per job posting.       The -score for a company with 143 job applicants per job posting is 1.84 standard deviations       You scored an 89 on a math test where the class mean and standard deviation are 75 points and 7 points respectively. You scored a 65 on an English test where the mean and standard deviation are 53 points and 4 points, respectively. In which class did you do better? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -score of my English test is greater than the -score of my math test, I did better on the English test than I did on the math test.    The mean running time for comedy movies is 139 minutes, with a standard deviation of 39.7 minutes. For action movies, the mean running time is 159 minutes, with a standard deviation of 26.2 minutes. A recent comedy movie had a running time of 102 minutes, while an action movie playing at the same theatre had a running time of 129 minutes. Which movie is shorter compared to other movies in the same genre? Explain your answer using Z-score.         Because the -score for the 129 minute action movie was less than the -score for the 102 comedy movie, the action movie was shorter than the comedy movie, when both movies are compared to other movies in their genres.    Poe, the Clydesdale horse has a world record breaking height of 20.2 hands. All Clydesdale horses have a mean height of 16.5 hands and a standard deviation of 1.85 hands. The last Great Dane to hold the world record for dog height was Gibson who was 107 cm tall. Great Danes have a mean height of 81 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm. Which animal is taller compared to their respective breed? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -scores for the heights of Poe (the Clydesdale horse) and Gibson (the Great Dane) are the same, neither animal is taller than the other when compared to their respective breeds.    "

The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.      Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died. Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.   "

By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple’s Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.

Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie’s weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.  "

  "body": " Function Notation and Linear Functions   Student Learning Outcomes   After completing this activity you will be able to:    Interpret the meaning of function notation.  Use function notation to describe an event.  Evaluate a function and solve an equation using function notation.  Perform calculations using function notation including Average Rate of Change.  Translate problems from a variety of contexts into mathematical representation and vice versa (linear, exponential, simple quadratics).  Identify when a linear model is reasonable for a given situation and, when appropriate, formulate a linear model. In the context of the situation interpret the slope and intercepts and determine the reasonable domain and range.  Use functional models to make predictions and solve problems.     In this activity we define a function and develop an understanding of function notation by comparing statements we already understand in English to equivalent statements written in math language.  The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to read a graph or a table of values and how to use a formula to make a calculation.     What is a Function?  The mathematical concept of a function can be extremely complicated. It took thousands of years to come up with it, define it and formalize it. For example, just look at this definition from Wikipedia (do not spend too much time on it.)  You could spend your whole life learning about what a function is and never get to the rest of this book! For this reason we will keep things simple and informal in order to attain a quick and accessible understanding of topics, including functions. Students continuing in mathematics will add to their knowledge of functions as needed and as part of a life-long process.  Start by remembering this: one input, one output.  A function  function is a rule that takes a piece of usable information that you choose (input) and gives you some kind of result (output). By usable we mean information that has meaning for the function.  Think of a function as a sort of machine. Using some input, the machine does something to the input and then out pops a result. In this course our inputs will be mostly numbers and the process will yield numbers as results.   Temperature Converter   A simple example of a function is a temperature converter. It converts a temperature from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.  The function is the rule or process used to convert from one unit of temperature to the other.  Our function is a graph, but it could have been a table of values or a formula.  The graph illustrates that the temperature in degrees Celsius is a function of the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, , is the input while the temperature in degrees Celsius, , is the output.     Use the graph to estimate your answers below:   The temperature of degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius    What temperature in Fahrenheit is the same as degrees Celsius?    The temperature of degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius    What temperature in Fahrenheit is the same as degrees Celsius?       The first two are shown as ordered pairs. If you recognize that 77 is an input value and -20 is an output value, then you can see that and .  For the last two, you must pay attention to the horizontal and vertical axes. Recognize that the tick-marks go by 2's, so and .    This brings up some good questions:     How do we communicate that we have a function? There has to be a simple or quick way to communicate we have a function.    What kinds of inputs can the function use? The temperature function in the previous exercise could only accept temperatures between and degrees Fahrenheit. The input of degrees is not usable because it is not available to choose.    What are the possible output temperatures in degrees Celsius? Is any temperature possible or is there a window of reasonable temperature expectations?    How are the two temperature units related? If you increase degrees F, does the temperature in degrees also increase?     We start with notation. We don't want to keep writing the word, F U N C T I O N, all the time. That's just way too many letters.    Math as a Language  Math is just another language. We use it to communicate measurements, changes in value and how things are related to or affect one another. Almost everything you say or describe in Math, you can say or describe in English.  In this next exercise we learn to communicate the position of a train as time passes and develop the notation to express where the train is at different times. We will assume that this train runs on time, every day and the conditions every day are the same. You know, an alternate universe called example land .   Consider the graph below. The dot on the graph represents the position of a train at a particular time. The cross-hairs represent the time. Notice that the train’s distance, in miles, from downtown depends on the time, in hours, after 8 a.m.   How far from downtown is the train at 10 a.m.?  Since 10 a.m. is 8 a.m. + 2 hours, and we have the point (2,30) labelled on the graph, we see that the train is 30 miles from downtown at 10am.   In English you can communicate information about time and position in a simple sentence like    hours after  a.m. the train is miles from downtown.   Here is what that same sentence looks like in Spanish.    horas despues de las 8 de la mañana el tren esta 30 millas lejos del centro.   Here is what that same sentence could look like in math .         The Grammar of Function Notation  The math sentence above is actually an equation and it uses function notation  function notation  notation for functions to express the information about the train's position at a particular time.  In math we don't really have subjects or verbs or objects. Instead we have input values (numbers) and we have output values. The function is the machine or the rule that tells us how to use the input to make an output.   variable Variables are used to represent values we don't know or that may change. For a function, the input is called the independent variable , and the output is called the dependent variable . This is because the output depends on the input.  The distance from downtown is constantly changing with time, so we can let the dependent variable represent the Train's distance in miles from downtown . Similarly, we can use the independent variable to represent the number of hours after  a.m. .  Typically, we use variables that have something to do with the context of the problem, but sometimes we generalize an expression or equation with 's and 's when we have nothing specific in mind.   Variables have units  If the variables represent actual things or events, we must define them to include the units  units we used to measure the event. This allows us to extract meaning from the values or expressions.  If you know Spanish you can interpret the meaning of a Spanish article you read by translating it into English. Likewise, if you know math , you can interpret the meaning of function notation by translating it into English, provided you know what the variables in the notation mean or what they are measuring.   If represents distance, you must define the units in which the distance is measured: miles, inches, centimeters, light years, etc.    If represents time, will it be measured with units of seconds, hours or years?    Since the position of the train depends on the amount of time that has passed, we say the distance depends on time . More specifically, we say that the distance of the train from downtown is a function of time .  Function notation allows us to communicate that distance is a function of time by simply writing . The notation is read as, of .  Remember is a value. The function uses to create the value .  Also, don't confuse the notation with multiplication! The expression does not mean times .   The word function usually refers to the actual rule which turns the input into the output. Sometimes, however, we will use it to describe the output of the relationship.     How would you say the function notation in each statement below?    Tarzan(the jungle)   Tarzan times the jungle  Tarzan jungle  Tarzan of the jungle  Jungle after Tarzan     Helen(Troy)   Helen loves Troy  Helen multiplied by Troy  Helen next to Troy  Helen of Troy       f of x  f times x  f parentheses x  f x       Function notation like or or implies there is some kind of relation, some kind of rule, that takes a piece of information and returns a response or result. The format of function notation works on the basic principle of input and output and we often use the notation when we refer to things we don't yet know.  For instance, if you work as a health assistant, you probably earn some hourly salary and you probably work some number of hours each week. I have no idea how many hours a week you work and no idea how much you earn. But I do know your weekly salary is related to the number of hours you work. In fact, your weekly salary is a function of the number of hours you work.  If is the number of hours you work and is your weekly salary, I can use function notation to say , where is the function, the instructions, that calculates your weekly salary. If you work hours, then , so is your weekly salary for working hours.  Notice I still don't know what the salary actually is, but I can use function notation to talk about it. The expression literally means, whatever you earn when you work hours.   In our train example we chose some input, a time, and the function gave us an output of distance. The notation tells the reader what the input is by showing it in the parentheses: The function notation is telling us the input is . That means, hours after  a.m. In other words, it's  a.m.   On the other hand, represents an output. It is the train's distance from downtown, hours after  a.m. But we don't know what that distance actually is yet. In this case, the notation means Whatever the distance is at t = 0 .  Nonetheless, the input and output create an ordered pair  ordered pair  . On a graph the ordered pair is a point . point     The graph below is a function that illustrates a train's distance from downtown, in miles, as a function of time in hours after  a.m. When using a graph the best you can do is estimate. Since represents a distance at  a.m. , we can use the graph to find what the distance is.      What is approximately equal to?  What time is referring to?  The notation is read as of zero. What do you think means in the context of this train story?  How would you represent the statement train's distance at 10 a.m. using function notation?     Here is another example to further explore the use function notation.   Let be a function in which the input is the area of a house (measured in square feet), and the output is the value of the house in dollars. Consider the equation The notation gives us information about the house. Given ,  What is the area of the house?  What is the value of the house?  Interpret the meaning of in English.      900 square feet  $209,700  A 900 square foot house has a value of $209,700.       Average Rate of Change, Inuitive Knowledge   In this activity we introduce the Greek letter that represents change, and we develop the concept of average rate of change .  The prerequisites for this lesson are knowing how to calculate the slope of a line and understanding the meaning of slope.  Let's start by realizing you already understand the concept of average rate of change, but maybe you have never heard the phrase before.   It turns out, average rate of change is just another way to talk about slope. As the name implies, it measures how quickly things change, on average.  Common examples of average rate of change:     Traveling from Portland, OR to Seattle, WA (about miles) in hours is an average speed of  50  .    Pressure at the surface of the ocean is about  14.6  (pounds per square inch). If you dive under water feet the pressure is about  23.6  . That's an average rate of pressure increase of about  0.45  pounds per square inch, per foot underwater.    Earning for hours of work is an average hourly pay rate of dollars per hour.     In each example there is a function that relates an input with an output. When the input changes by some amount, the output will also change (though usually by some other amount).  The change in the output divided by the change in the input is called an average rate of change  average rate of change of the function.  Be careful to remember that we are only talking about an average . For instance, no one can drive from Portland to Seattle at a constant speed. There is always stop and go traffic, variations in speed limits, etc.    The interactive graph below is that of a function where D is the number of miles a train is from downtown at hours after 8 am.       As the time changes along the horizontal axis the result is the changing position of the train measured on the vertical axis. The key word here is change     Use the graph to find the change in distance between the and  A.M. .    What is the change in time between the and  A.M. ?    What is the average speed (rate of change) between and  A.M. ?    Use function notation (as in part a) to write an expression that represents the change in distance between the  A.M. and  P.M. .          miles.    The change in time is 2 hour(s).    The average speed is miles per hour.    The change in distance can be expressed as        In math we use the Greek letter to mean change in . Change between two values is typically measured by subtracting an old value from a new value.  In our train story where , the expression means change in miles from downtown . As the train travels away from downtown, the distance from downtown increases. New distance is greater than old distance, so traveling away from downtown is a positive change in distance.  However, the distance from downtown decreases as the train travels towards downtown. New distance is less than old distance, therefore traveling toward downtown is a negative change in distance.       Use the graph to find the value of during the first hours of the trip  What is the meaning of the expression in the context of the train story?  Change in hours since 8 a.m.  Delta t  Delta times t  There is no meaning to this expression       miles  Change in hours since 8 a.m.      Three Representations of a Relationship  In 2002, the poverty rate of each state in the United States of America (plus D.C. and Puerto Rico) were recorded, as well as the number of births performed by teenage mothers ages 15-17. The data is plotted below, along with a trend line of best fit.   The units for the -axis are people below the poverty line per 100 people in each state or territory. The -axis is measured in births per 1000 girls ages 15-17 for each state or territory.  A graph provides a visual representation of the situation. It helps you see how the variables are related to each other and make predictions about future values or values in between those in your table. The horizontal and vertical axis of the graph should be labeled, including units.  The equation for the red line is   This is an equation for a model . This equation is useful because it can be used to calculate the expected teen pregnancy rate given a state's poverty rate. Equations are useful for communicating complex relationships. In writing equations, it is always important to define what the variables represent, including units. For example, in the equation above, is in births per 1000 girls ages 15-17, and is in people living in a household below the poverty line per 100 people.  Another way that you could have represented this relationship is in a table that shows values of t and B as ordered pairs. An ordered pair is two values that are matched together in a given relationship. You used a table in the last lesson. Tables are helpful for recognizing patterns and general relationships or for giving information about specific values. A table should always have labels for each column. The labels should include units when appropriate.

Linear Equations and Slope  The type of equation we looked at for poverty and teen pregnany is a linear equation, or a linear model. Recall that the graph of a linear equation is a line. The primary characteristic of a linear equation is that it has a constant rate of change, meaning that each time the input increases by one, the output changes by a fixed amount. In the example above, if one state as 1 more person per 100 below the poverty line than another state, then we expect the first state to have 1.3733 more pregnancies per 1000 girls 15-17 years old. This constant rate of change is also called slope.    If I were walking at a constant speed, my distance would change 6 miles in 2 hours. We could compute the slope or rate of change as   In general, we can compute slope as    In the graph shown, we can see that the graph is a line, so the equation is linear. We can compute the slope using any two pairs of points by counting how much the input and output change, and divide them. Notice that we get the same slope regardless of which points we use.    If the output increases as the input increases, we consider that a positive change. If the output decreases as the input increases, that is a negative change, and the slope will be negative.    Some people call the calculation of slope \"rise over run\" , where \"rise\" refers to the vertical change in output, and \"run\" refers to the horizontal change of input.  The units on slope will be a rate based on the units of the output and input variables. It will have units of \"output units per input units\". For example,   Input: hours. Output: miles. Slope: miles per hour  Input: number of cats. Output: pounds of litter. Slope: pounds of litter per cat     Slope Intercept Equation of a Line  The slope-intercept form of a line, the most common way you'll see linear equations written, is   where is the slope, and is the vertical intercept (called y intercept when the output variable is ). In the equation, is the input variable, and is the output variable.  Notice our equation from earlier,   fits this form where the slope is 1.3733 and the vertical intercept is 4.2673. The input variable is and the output variable is .    From the equation of our model What units are the numbers 4.2673 and 1.3733 in? Describe what each number means in terms of the model.    According to our model, we would expect a state with no poverty to have a pregnancy rate among 1000 girls 15-17 at about 4.2673. And for any state whose poverty rate increases by 1 person per 100, the pregnancy rate for 1000 girls ages 15-17 is expected to go up 1.3733. So we could verbally describe the relationship as: A state's expected pregnancy rate per 1000 girls ages 15-17 is 4.2673 plus 1.3733 for every person per 100 living in a household below the poverty line.

Their plan is to sell team T-shirts to friends and family, and they hope to raise $500. Their local screen printing shop will charge them a $75 setup fee, plus $6 per shirt, and they plan to sell the shirts for $15 each.  Explore their profit (the amount they bring in from sales minus costs) using graphs and\/or tables. Use these to estimate how many shirts the team will have to sell to reach their goal.  How much profit does the team make for each shirt they sell?  Create an equation for the linear model for their profit in terms of the number of shirts they sell.  How much money will they raise if they can sell 30 shirts?  How many shirts will they have to sell to avoid losing money?  How many shirts will they have to sell to raise their goal of $500?

In 1965, Gordon Moore, the cofounder of Intel, observed that the number of transistors on a computer chip had doubled every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore predicted that the pace would slow down a bit, but the number of transistors would continue to double every 2 years. More recently, data density has doubled approximately every 18 months, and this is the current definition of Moore's law. Most experts, including Moore himself, expected Moore's law to hold for at least another two decades.

A colony of bacteria starts with organisms and doubles every week.  Write a formula for the population of the bacteria colony after weeks.  How many bacteria will there be after weeks? After days?        The initial value of the population was , and its weekly growth factor is . Thus, a formula for the population after weeks is  After weeks, the population will be Because days is of a week, after days the population will be We cannot have a fraction of a bacterium, so we round to the nearest whole number, .      In part 1, note that According to the order of operations, we compute the power first, then multiply by .        How can you tell from a table of values that a function describes exponential growth?    A population of 24 fruit flies triples every month. Write a formula for the population of fruit flies after months.    How many fruit flies will there be after 6 months?    After 3 weeks?    Is equivalent to ?          During each equal time interval, the output increases by the same factor.         17,496    55 (estimated using 4 weeks = 1 month)    No, powers are performed before products.        Growth Factors  In , the rabbit population grew by a factor of every months.  table of rabbit population  The variable is given in months, so to write the growth formula for this population, we divide the value of by The value of gives us the number of doubling periods. Now we need some algebra to see the growth factor for the function. We use the third law of exponents to write in another form. Recall that to raise a power to a power, we multiply exponents, so The growth law for the rabbit population is thus The initial value of the function is , and the growth factor is , or approximately . The rabbit population grows by a factor of about every month.  If the units are the same, a population with a larger growth factor grows faster than one with a smaller growth factor.    A lab technician compares the growth of species of bacteria. She starts colonies of bacteria each. Species A doubles in population every days, and species B triples every days. Find the growth factor for each species.    A function describing the growth of species A is so the growth factor for species A is , or approximately . For species B, so the growth factor for species B is , or approximately . Species B grows faster than species A.         A population triples every four years. What is its annual growth factor?    In 1999, analysts expected the number of Internet service providers to double in five years. What was the annual growth factor for the number of Internet service providers?    If there were Internet service providers in April 1999, estimate the number of providers in April 2000 and in April 2001.    Write a formula for , the number of Internet service providers years after 1999.                     and              Percent Increase  Exponential growth occurs in other circumstances, too. For example, if the interest on a savings account is compounded annually, the amount of money in the account grows exponentially.  Consider a principal of $100 invested at 5% interest compounded annually. At the end of year, the amount is It will be more useful to write the formula for the amount after year in factored form. With this version of the formula, the calculation for the amount at the end of year looks like this:  The amount, $105, becomes the new principal for the second year. To find the amount at the end of the second year, we apply the formula again, with . Observe that to find the amount at the end of each year, we multiply the principal by a factor of . Thus, we can express the amount at the end of the second year as and at the end of the third year as   At the end of each year, we multiply the old balance by another factor of to get the new amount. We organize our results into a table, where represents the amount of money in the account after years. For this example, a formula for the amount after years is                        In general, for an initial investment of dollars at an interest rate compounded annually, we have the following formula for the amount accumulated after years.  Compound Interest compound interest  The amount accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded annually is where  This function describes exponential growth with an initial value of and a growth factor of .  The notion of percent increase percent increase is often used to describe the growth factor for quantities that grow exponentially.

However, for each unit increase in , units are added to the value of , whereas the value of is multiplied by . An exponential function with growth factor eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope , as you can see by comparing the graphs in the figure or the function values in the tables.

We would like to find values of and so that the given function values satisfy . By substituting the function values into the formula, we can write two equations. This is a system of equations in the two unknowns, and , but it is not a linear system. We can solve the system by the method of elimination, but we will divide one of the equations by the other. Note that by dividing the two equations, we eliminated , and we can now solve for . Next we substitute into either of the two equations and solve for . Thus, and , so the function is .  Knowing only two points on the graph of f is not enough to tell us what kind of function is. Through the two points in , we can also fit a linear function or a power function.

This method is sometimes called the ratio method ratio method . (Of course, if one of the known function values is the initial value, we can find without resorting to the ratio method.)   To find an exponential function through two points:     Use the coordinates of the points to write two equations in and .   Divide one equation by the other to eliminate .  Solve for .  Substitute into either equation and solve for .       Use the ratio method to find an exponential function whose graph includes the points and .       We can use the ratio method to find an exponential growth or decay model if we know two function values.  The unit of currency in Ghana is the cedi, denoted by ¢. Beginning in 1986, the cedi underwent a period of exponential inflation. In 1993, one U.S. dollar was worth ¢720, and in 1996, the dollar was worth about ¢1620. Find a formula for the number of cedi to the dollar as a function of time since 1986. What was the annual inflation rate?  We want to find a function for the number of cedi to the dollar, where in 1986. We have two function values, , and , and with these values we can write two equations. We divide the second equation by the first to find Now we can solve this last equation for to get . Finally, we substitute into the first equation to find . Thus, , and the annual inflation rate was %.    The number of earthquakes that occur worldwide is a decreasing exponential function of their magnitude on the Richter scale. Between 2000 and 2005, there were 7480 earthquakes of magnitude 5 and 793 earthquakes of magnitude 6. (Source: National Earthquake Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey)    Find a formula for the number of earthquakes, , in terms of their magnitude.  It is difficult to keep an accurate count of small earthquakes. Use your formula to estimate the number of magnitude 1 earthquakes that occurred between 2000 and 2005.  How many earthquakes of magnitude 8 occurred?        ;      Doubling Time doubling time  Instead of giving the rate of growth of a population, we can specify its rate of growth by giving the time it takes for the population to double.  In 2005, the population of Egypt was million and was growing by % per year.  If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?  How long will it take the population to double again?  Illustrate the results on a graph.    The population of Egypt is growing according to the formula , where is in years and is in millions. We would like to know when the population will reach million (twice million), so we solve the equation It will take the population about years to double.  Twice 148 million is 296 million, so we solve the equation It will take the population about years to double again.  A graph of is shown below. Note that the population doubles every 35 years.  graph showing doubling time   In , it took the population years to double. Notice that the calculations in parts (a) and (b) are identical after the first step. In fact, we can start at any point, and it will take the population years to double. We say that years is the doubling time for this population. In the Homework problems, you will show that any increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.

Which statement is true?   The doubling time of a population depends on its initial value.    An increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.    The doubling time is twice the percent growth rate.    The doubling time is half the percent growth rate.            million  years  ; , i.e., ; , i.e., ; , i.e.,   An increasing exponential function has a constant doubling time.       If we know the doubling time for a population, we can immediately write down its growth law.

At its current rate of growth, the population of Mexico will double in 36.8 years. What is its annual percent rate of growth?    How can you find the growth factor for an exponential function when you know its doubling time?          1.9%    [TODO]        Half-Life  The half-life half-life of a decreasing exponential function is the time it takes for the output to decrease to half its original value. For example, the half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The half-life of a drug is the time it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated from the body. Like the doubling time, the half-life is constant for a particular function; no matter where you start, it takes the same amount of time to reach half that value.   If you take mg of ibuprofen to relieve sore muscles, the amount of the drug left in your body after hours is .  What is the half-life of ibuprofen?  When will mg of ibuprofen remain in your body?  Use the half-life to sketch a graph of .    To find the half-life, we calculate the time elapsed when only half the original amount, or mg, is left. The half-life is hours.  After hours, mg of ibuprofen is left in the body. After another hours, half of that amount, or mg, is left. Thus, mg remain after hours.  We locate multiples of hours on the horizontal axis. After each interval of hours, the amount of ibuprofen is reduced to half its previous value. The graph is shown below.   graph showing half-life                  \\   Melatonin is an over the counter drug that can be used as a sleeping pill.

Blood pressure is a periodic function of time.  After an injection is given to a patient, the amount of the drug present in his bloodstream decreases exponentially. The patient receives injections at regular intervals to restore the drug level to the prescribed level. The amount of the drug present is a periodic function of time.

You may need to use your common sense and knowledge of the world. Considering the grey shaded area of uncertainty:   Why do you suppose that there is more uncertainty with the graph of temperature compared to the graph of carbon dioxide levels?   Think about how they are measured. The main source for temperature is tree ring data. Is it as easy to tell the temperature from tree rings as it is to measure trapped in layers of a glacier?

Take off points for bad or insufficient reasoning. 5 points.   Why is the uncertainty so much less for the temperatures closer to present day?   When were thermometers invented? Since when have we been recording temperatures all around the globe?   Answers will vary. The main goal is for them to realize the difficulty of determining global temperatures before the thermometer was invented. Take off points for bad or insufficient reasoning. 5 points.   The figure above has been described as the hockey stick graph , and there has been controversy around it. An article in The Guardian described some of the controversy:   Reconstructing past temperatures from proxy data is fraught with danger. Tree ring records, the biggest component of the hockey stick record, sometimes reflect rain or drought rather than temperature. When I investigated the continuing row surrounding the graph in 2006, Gordon Jacoby of Columbia University in New York, said: \"Mann has a series from central China that we believe is more a moisture signal than a temperature signal... He included it because he had a gap. That was a mistake and it made tree-ring people angry.\" A large data set he used from bristlecone pines in the American west has attracted similar concern.  Deciding which data sets to include in such reconstructions was, if not arbitrary, then open to dispute. And dispute there was. In the late 1990s, the researchers in heated debate about what they could and could not reliably show about past temperatures, and how to represent their findings.    If some researchers dispute which tree ring data sets Mann, Bradley, and Hughes used, then why does it matter?   Answers will vary. I'm looking for the students to show that they understand that choosing which data to consider can affect the average of the data. 5 points.   Because of the controversy the scientists were investigated by the EPA, Pennsylvania University (where Mann was a professor), the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce, and the Office of the Inspector General of the National Science Foundation. All of these institutions cleared them of any wrongdoing.  Why does it matter that these institutions cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing?   There are many correct ways to answer this question. We are looking for you to show good quantitative reasoning.   Answers will vary. Grade on how much their answer makes sense, but be lenient or at least make helpful commments if you take off points because we do not want students to believe they are losing points for their opinions or political beliefs.    Read: the two page summary of this internal memo from the Exxon company from 1982 1982-Exxon-Memo-to-Management-About-CO2.pdf   Then compare their math model of temperature (Figure 3 on page 7) with the actual global average temperature given at the top of this site ncdc.noaa.gov\/sotc\/global\/202013   Describe how the predictions from the 1982 memo compare to what actually happened.

During the Constitutional Convention, the framers were tasked with making decisions on the three branches of government and how people (or those considered to be people) would be represented. At that time only white men with property were allowed to vote.  In creating the Legislative Branch of government, it was decided that Congress would be made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Representation for the Senate would be equal with two senators per state. To account for the different sizes of the states, the representation in the House of Representatives would be proportional to the state's population, but there was a controversy over how to count the population.   Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.  United States Constitution, Article I, Section 2, Clause 3     What is Apportionment?  The number of representatives each state gets is based on its population, so once the framers decided how to count the population, they had to figure out how to divide up the representatives. This math problem is called apportionment.   Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes. In the United States, there is a certain number of representatives as stated in the constitution, currently 435, and they need to be divided fairly among the 50 states. Since the states are different sizes, and we cannot use fractions of people, this is not an easy task. In addition, the population in each state may change over time. Every 10 years after the census is taken, the representatives are reapportioned.  The apportionment problem comes up in a variety of non-political areas too. Here are the rules for apportionment in general.   Apportionment rules     The things being divided up can exist only in whole numbers.    We must use all of the things being divided up, and we cannot use any more.    Each group must get at least one of the things being divided up.    The number of things assigned to each group should be at least approximately proportional to the population of the group. (Exact proportionality isn't possible because of the whole number requirement, but we should try to be close.)      In terms of the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives, these rules imply:   We can only have whole representatives (a state can't have 3.4 representatives).    We can only use the 435 representatives available.    Every state gets at least one representative.    The number of representatives each state gets should be approximately proportional to the state population. This way, the number of constituents each representative has should be approximately equal.     We will look at four ways of solving the apportionment problem, developed by different people: Hamilton, Jefferson, Webster, and the Huntington-Hill method that is used today. We will continue to look at U.S. history throughout this section including Hamilton, Jefferson and Webster's relationship to slavery.    Hamilton's Method  Alexander Hamilton (1755 - 1804) was raised in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands by a poor family. He was motivated by his low socioeconomic status to work himself into a higher social standing. He eventually came to the colonies and worked himself into circles of wealth and influence. While Hamilton wasn't pro-slavery and considered himself an abolitionist, when choosing between his societal status and moral obligation, he chose the former.  He wed Elizabeth Schuyler, who was from a prominent family who owned slaves. He was involved with the transactions of slaves for his in-laws which further muddled his anti-slavery stance. Furthermore, Hamilton also traded and sold slaves as part of his duties for the Continental Army.  Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was approved by Congress in 1791 but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later adopted in 1852 and used through 1910. He begins by determining, to several decimal places, how many people each representative should represent (the divisor).   Hamilton's Method     Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .   Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolved the whole number problem as follows:     Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.  Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative.      Let's see how this works in an example.    A new state called Graceland has three counties: A, B and C. The State House of Representatives has 41 members. If the legislature wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let's pretend they do), let's use Hamilton's method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows:     County  Population    A  162,310    B  538,479    C  197,145    Total  897,934     Step 1: First, we divide the total population by the number of representatives to find the divisor: .  Step 2: Now we determine each county's quota by dividing the county's population by the divisor: For example, for A, we take which equals 7.4111.     County  Population  Quota    A  162,310  7.4111    B  538,479  24.5872    C  197,945  9.0017    Total  897,934      Step 3: Removing the decimal parts of the quotas gives our initial apportionment and we add those numbers up.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    A  162,310  7.4111  7    B  538,479  24.5872  24    C  197,945  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40     Step 4: We need 41 representatives, and right now we only have 40. The remaining one goes to the county with the largest decimal part, which is B:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    A  162,310  7.4111  7  7    B  538,479  24. 5872  24 +1  25    C  197,945  9.0017  9  9    Total  897,934   40  41     Our final apportionment is A: 7, B: 25, C: 9, for a total of 41 representatives.      We will use Hamilton's method again, to apportion 75 seats for a new state of Lewis, which has five counties. Lewis and its counties are named for civil rights leaders John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, Daisy Bates and Roy Wilkins.    Step 1: The divisor is .  Step 2: Determine each county's quota by dividing its population by the divisor:     County  Population  Quota    Parks  49,875  3.5538    King  166,158  11.8395    Baker  82,888  5.9061    Bates  626,667  44.6528    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478    Total  1,052,567      Step 3: Remove the decimal part of each quota and add up the initial apportionment:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   72     Step 4: We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we assign the remaining three, one each, to the three counties with the largest decimal parts, which are Baker, King, and Bates in that order:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3  3    King  166,158  11. 8395  11 +1  12    Baker  82,888  5. 9061  5 +1  6    Bates  626,667  44. 6528  44 +1  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9    Total  1,052,567   72  75     Our final apportionment is Parks: 3, King: 12, Baker: 6, Bates: 45, and Wilkins: 9 for a total of 75 representatives.  Note that even though Parks County's decimal part is greater than .5, it isn't big enough to get an additional representative, because three other counties have greater decimal parts.    Hamilton's method obeys something called the Quota Rule. The Quota Rule isn't a law, but an idea that some people think is a good one.   Quota Rule  The Quota Rule says that the final number of representatives a state gets should be within one of that state's quota. Since we're dealing with whole numbers for our final answers, that means that each state should either go up to the next whole number above its quota, or down to the next whole number below its quota.     Problems with Hamilton's Method  After using Hamilton's method for many years, three paradoxes happened, on separate occasions, where unfair things happened in new apportionments. This led to other methods being needed.   The Alabama Paradox is named for an incident that happened during the apportionment that took place after the 1880 census. (A similar incident happened ten years earlier involving the state of Rhode Island, but the paradox is named after Alabama.) The post-1880 apportionment had been completed, using Hamilton's method and the new population numbers from the census. Then it was decided that because of the country's growing population, the House of Representatives should be made larger. That meant that the apportionment would need to be done again, still using Hamilton's method and the same 1880 census numbers, but with more representatives. The assumption was that some states would gain another representative and others would stay with the same number they already had (since there weren't enough new representatives being added to give one more to every state). The paradox is that Alabama ended up losing a representative in the process, even though no populations were changed, and the total number of representatives increased.   The New States Paradox happened when Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Oklahoma had enough population to qualify for five representatives in Congress. Those five representatives would need to come from somewhere, though, so five states, presumably, would lose one representative each. That happened, but another thing also happened: Maine gained a representative (from New York).   The Population Paradox happened between the apportionments after the census of 1900 and of 1910. In those ten years, Virginia's population grew at an average annual rate of 1.07%, while Maine's grew at an average annual rate of 0.67%. Virginia started with more people, grew at a faster rate, grew by more people, and ended up with more people than Maine. By itself, that doesn't mean that Virginia should gain representatives or Maine shouldn't, because there are lots of other states involved. But Virginia ended up losing a representative to Maine .    Jefferson's Method  Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton's method, Jefferson's method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton's. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest at the time. He would also argue that it's the ratio of people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that.  The first three steps of Jefferson's method are the same as Hamilton's. He found the same divisor and the same quota and cut off the decimal parts in the same way, giving the same initial apportionment that is less than the required total.  What changes is how Jefferson assigned the remaining representatives. He said that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must have been too big. He changed the divisor by making it smaller and looked at the new total. He would raise or lower the divisor until he found one that produced the required total. This is a trial and error process that takes some patience.   Jefferson's Method  The first three steps are the same as Hamilton's    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If you lower it too far, increase it. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor you end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.        We'll return to the state of Graceland and apply Jefferson's method. We begin, as we did with Hamilton's method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor, 21,900.82927.  Steps 1-3 are the same as Hamilton's Method. Since we will be using different divisors, we will write the divisor at the bottom of the population column to be clear what we are dividing each number in that column by. You can also write it above that column if you prefer.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    A  162,310  7.4111  7    B  538,479  24.5872  24    C  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40    Divisor  21,900.82927       We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40. We must reduce the divisor until we get 41 representatives. Let's try 21,500 as the divisor  Step 4:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    A  162,310  7.5493  7    B  538479  25.0455  25    C  197,145  9.1695  9    Total  897,934   41    Divisor  21,500       That worked and our final apportionment is A: 7, B: 25, and C: 9.  Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for B County (the largest county in the state) increased by much more than those of A County or C County.  In this example, we got lucky and found the modified divisor on the first try. If we still had 40, we would reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we would need to raise it. We will show how to do the trial-and-error part in the next example.      We'll apply Jefferson's method for Lewis. The original divisor of 14,034.22667 gave these results:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   72    Divisor  14,034.22667       We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we need to use a smaller divisor. Let's try lowering it to 13,500:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.6944  3    King  166,158  12.3080  12    Baker  82,888  6.1399  6    Bates  626,667  46.4198  46    Wilkins  126,979  9.4059  9    Total  1,052,567   76    Divisor  13,500       We got a total of 76 representatives which is too many, so we lowered it too far. We need a divisor that's greater than 13,500 but less than 14,034.22667. Let's try 13,700:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.6405  3    King  166,158  12.1283  12    Baker  82,888  6.0502  6    Bates  626,667  45.7421  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.2685  9    Total  1,052,567   75    Divisor  13,700       Using a modified divisor of 13,700 gives us exactly 75 representatives. Note there is usually more than one modified divisor that will work.  This can take a lot of writing, so in practice, we can write this all out in one table. With each try we are dividing the population by the new divisor to get the new quotas.     County  Population  Quota  Initial  2nd Quota  2nd Try  3rd Quota  Final    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3  3.6944  3  3.6405  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11  12.3080  12  12.1283  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5  6.1399  6  6.0502  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44  46.4198  46  45.7421  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9.4059  9  9.2685  9    Total  1,052,567   72   76   75    Divisor  14,034.22667    13,500   13,700      Notice, in comparison to Hamilton's method, that although the results were the same, they came about in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Bates County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before King (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule.      Webster's Method  Daniel Webster (1782-1852) was a lawyer, congressman, Senator of Massachusetts and also served as the U.S. Secretary of State. He was from the North and did not own slaves. He was an opponent of slavery extension and he spoke against annexing Texas and against going to war with Mexico. He argued, however, that no law was needed to prevent the further extension of slavery in new states and he supported the Compromise of 1850, which disappointed his abolitionist supporters (History.com Editors, 2018b).  Webster proposed a method similar to Jefferson's in 1832. It was adopted by Congress in 1842 but replaced by Hamilton's method in 1852. It was then adopted again in 1911. The difference is that Webster rounded the quotas to the nearest whole number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that didn't produce the exact number of representatives, he adjusted the divisor like in Jefferson's method. (In Jefferson's case, the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always the case with Webster's method because some numbers may be rounded up.)   Webster's Method  Steps 1-2 are the same as Hamilton and Jefferson    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 3 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.      Let's see how Webster's method works in this example:    We will look at Graceland again, with an initial divisor of 21,900.82927 and 41 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    A  162,310  7.4111  7    B  538,479  24.5872  25    C  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   41    Divisor  21,900.82927       This time B is the only county with a decimal of 0.5 or higher, so it gets rounded up. This gives the required total, so we're done.      Let's look at Lewis again, with an initial divisor of 14,034.22667 and 75 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  4    King  166,158  11.8395  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   76    Divisor  14,034.22667       This is one too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5372  4    King  166,158  11.7843  12    Baker  82,888  5.8786  6    Bates  626,667  44.4445  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0056  9    Total  1,052,567   75    Divisor  14,100       This gives us exactly 75, so we're done. This is how it would look all in one table:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  2nd Quota  2nd Try    Parks  49,875  3.5538  4  3.5371  4    King  166,158  11.8395  12  11.7843  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  6  5.8786  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  45  44.4445  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9.0056  9    Total  1,052,567   76   75    Divisor  14,034.22667    14,100        Like Jefferson's method, Webster's method carries a bias in favor of larger states but rounding the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias. Notice that Bates County, the largest, is the one that gets a representative trimmed because of the increased quota.  Also, like Jefferson's method, Webster's method does not always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than Jefferson's method does. In fact, if Webster's method had been applied to every apportionment of Congress in all of U.S. history, it would have followed the quota rule every single time.    Land Rights, Citizenship and Voting Rights  In 1830 the Indian Removal Act was signed by President Jackson. The Act relocated Native Americans to land west of the Mississippi and the forced journey is known as the Trail of Tears . To learn more, here is a link to an online museum exhibit with a timeline of Native American history and artifacts .  Toward the end of the Civil War, slaves were freed by Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863, but it was not until June 19th, 1865 that the last group of slaves in Texas learned they had been freed. This is now celebrated as Juneteenth https:\/\/www.juneteenth.com\/history.htm . You can read more about the timeline of slavery in this Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia .  Although they were technically free, Black people still faced unequal and unjust treatment. After Black men were granted the right to vote in 1869, voter suppression laws like poll taxes and literacy tests were implemented barriers to voting (American Civil Liberties Union, 2020).  In 1887, the Dawes Act was passed, which allotted Native American land to individuals and 60 million acres were taken by the government or non-Indian homesteaders (Indian Land Trust Tenure Foundation, 2020). This act also provided citizenship under certain restrictions which theoretically allowed native men to vote. All women were granted the right to vote in 1920, but the barriers enacted for men of color applied to women of color as well. You can read more about voting rights and suppression in this online timeline .    Huntington-Hill Method  In 1920, no new apportionment was done, because Congress couldn't agree on the method to be used. They appointed a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued to use Webster's method in 1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 and is the method of apportionment still used today.  The Huntington-Hill Method is similar to Webster's method, but attempts to minimize the difference in the percentage of how many people each representative will represent.   Huntington-Hill Method  The first two steps are the same as the previous methods    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Cut off the decimal part of the quota to obtain the lower quota , which we'll call . Compute , which is the geometric mean of the lower quota and one value higher.    Instead of using 0.5 to round like we are used to, we use the geometric mean. If the quota is as large or larger than the geometric mean, round up; if the quota is smaller than the geometric mean, round down. This is the initial allocation. Add up the resulting whole numbers.    If the total from Step 4 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 4 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate. Continue doing this until the total is equal to the exact number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.        What is the Geometric Mean?  Let's look at why Hill and Huntington decided to use the geometric mean for rounding instead of the arithmetic mean of 0.5, which is halfway between two numbers. By calculating some geometric means and looking at them in a table we can see a pattern:    Geometric Mean Pattern        1     2     3     4         10         100       Notice that each geometric mean is between and . For smaller numbers, the decimal part is less than 0.5 and as n gets larger, the decimal part gets closer and closer to 0.5. This gives smaller states a chance to round up before larger states. That's how the Hill-Huntington method reduces the bias in favor of larger states.  Now let's see how to use the geometric mean in an example.    Again, we will practice with Graceland, with an initial divisor of 21,900.82927 and 41 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    A  162,310  7.4111  7   7    B  538,479  24.5872  24   25    C  197,945  9.0017  9   9    Total  897,934     41    Divisor  21,900.82927         Notice that for B, the quota of 24.5872 is above the geometric mean of 24.49, so we round up to 25. This gives the required total, so we're done.      Again, here is Lewis, with an initial divisor of 14,034.22667:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3   4    King  166,158  11.8395  11   12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5   6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44   45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9   9    Total  1,052,567     76    Divisor  14,034.22667         We end up with 76 which is too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  2nd Try    Parks  49,875  3.5372  3   4    King  166,158  11.7843  11   12    Baker  82,888  5.8786  5   6    Bates  626,667  44.4445  44   44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0056  9   9    Total  1,052,567     75    Divisor  14,100         This time Bates had a quota less than its geometric mean, so it did not get rounded up and we have exactly 75 representatives.  In both these cases, the apportionment produced by the Huntington-Hill method was the same as those from Webster's method, but that will not always be the case.    In 1980, two mathematicians, Peyton Young and Mike Balinski, proved what we now call the Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem.   Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem  The Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem shows that any apportionment method which always follows the quota rule will be subject to the possibility of paradoxes like the Alabama, New States, or Population paradoxes. In other words, we can choose a method that avoids those paradoxes, but only if we are willing to give up the guarantee of following the quota rule.     Consider a small country with 5 states, two of which are much larger than the others. We need to apportion 70 representatives. Apportion the representatives using both Webster's method and the Huntington-Hill method.     State  Population    A  300,500    B  200,000    C  50,000    D  38,000    E  21,500       Step 1: The total population is 610,000. Dividing this by the 70 representatives gives the divisor: 8714.286.  Step 2: Dividing each state's population by the divisor gives the quotas.     State  Population  Quota    A  300,500  34.48361    B  200,000  22.95082    C  50,000  5.737705    D  38,000  4.360656    E  21,500  2.467213    Total  610,000     Divisor  8714.286       Webster's Method   Step 3: Using Webster's method, we round each quota to the nearest whole number using the rounding rule of 0.5 or higher to round up.     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2    Total  610,000   69    Divisor  8714.286       Step 4: Adding these up only gives us 69 representatives, so we adjust the divisor down. We try 8,700, which gives us 70 representatives. Notice that State A, the largest state, is the one that got rounded up the second time.     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.54023  35    B  200,000  22.98851  23    C  50,000  5.747126  6    D  38,000  4.367816  4    E  21,500  2.471264  2    Total  610,000   70    Divisor  8,700        Huntington-Hill Method   Step 3: Using the Huntington-Hill method, we cut off the decimal to find the lower quota, then calculate the geometric mean based on each lower quota. If the quota is less than the geometric mean, we round down; if the quota is more than the geometric mean, we round up.     State  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34  34.49638  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23  22.49444  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6  5.477226  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4  4.472136  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2  2.44949  3    Total  610,000     70    Divisor  8714.286         These allocations add up to 70. Notice that this allocation is different than that produced by Webster's method. In this case, state E, which is smaller, got one more seat and state A got one less.    In this section we have learned four different methods of apportionment used in U.S. history, intertwined with the U.S. treatment of women, Native Americans and Black people. In the next section we will continue with our brief history of voting rights and look at different methods used for voting.

If the legislature grows to 11 seats, use Hamilton's method to apportion the seats.    Explain what happened in part b. What do you think would be a fair solution?    Try Jefferson's method for 11 seats. Does that solve the problem?         A: 4 seats, B: 4 seats, C: 2 seats    It is not possible to assign 11 seats with Hamilton's method in this case.    States A and C are the same size, so they have the same decimal value. They would both get an additional seat at the same time but there is only one seat to give. Answers will vary on fair solutions.    Yes, with a modified divisor of 1200 we get A: 5 seats, B: 5 seats and C: 1 seat.       A small country consists of three states, whose populations are listed below.     A  B  C    10,000  10,000  1,000        If the legislature has 10 seats, use Hamilton's method to apportion the seats. Which rule is not met in this case?    If the legislature grows to 11 seats, use Hamilton's method to apportion the seats.    If there could only be 10 seats, what do you think would be a fair solution?         A: 5 seats, B: 5 seats, C: 0 seats. Each state must have at least one seat so that rule is not met.    With 11 seats we have 5 seats, B: 5 seats, C: 1 seat, so it works in this case.    Answers will vary on fair solutions.       A state with five counties has 50 seats in their legislature. Using Hamilton's method, apportion the seats based on the 2010 census, then again using the 2020 census. Explain what happened in 2020 apportionment. Do you think it is fair?

This doesn't seem fair.    A state with five counties has 62 seats in their legislature. Using Hamilton's method, apportion the seats based on the 2010 census, then again using the 2010 census.

This seems reasonable because Candycane Forest grew more than Frosted Plains did.    A school district has two high schools: Clatsop, serving 1715 students, and Siletz, serving 7364. The district could only afford to hire 13 guidance counselors.   Determine how many counselors should be assigned to each school using Hamilton's method.    The following year, the district expands to include a third school, Cayuse, serving an additional 2989 students. Based on the divisor from above, how many additional counselors should be hired for Cayuse?    After hiring that many new counselors, the district recalculates the reapportion using Hamilton's method. Determine the outcome.    Explain what happened in the new apportionment. Do you think the outcome from part c is fair? Why or why not.         Clatsop: 2 counselors, Siletz: 11 counselors    The divisor was 698.38, so 4 new guidance counselors should be hired for Cayuse.    Clatsop: 3 counselors, Siletz: 10 counselors, Cayuse: 4 counselors    Cayuse did get 4 counselors, but one of the counselors from Siletz went to Clatsop. That doesn't seem fair because their populations didn't change.       A school district has two middle schools: Tubman, serving 451 students, and Blackshear, serving 176. The district could afford to hire 8 art teachers.   Determine how many art teachers should be assigned to each school using Hamilton's method.    The following year, the district expands to include a third school, Banneker, serving 231 additional students. Based on the divisor from above, how many additional art teachers should be hired for the new school?    After hiring that many new art teachers, the district recalculates the reapportion using Hamilton's method. Determine the outcome.    Explain what happened in the new apportionment. Do you think the outcome from part c is fair? Why or why not.         Tubman: 6 art teachers, Blackshear: 2 art teachers    The divisor was 78.375 so 2 new art teachers should be hired for Banneker.    Tubman: 5 art teachers, Blackshear: 2 art teachers, Banneker: 3 art teachers    In the new apportionment, Banneker got 3 art teachers, taking one from Tubman school. The quota for Banneker was 2.947, so it seems reasonable that Banneker would get 3 art teachers.       "

If the legislature wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let's pretend they do), let's use Hamilton's method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows:     County  Population    A  162,310    B  538,479    C  197,145    Total  897,934     Step 1: First, we divide the total population by the number of representatives to find the divisor: .

  "body": "  We'll return to the state of Graceland and apply Jefferson's method. We begin, as we did with Hamilton's method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor, 21,900.82927.  Steps 1-3 are the same as Hamilton's Method. Since we will be using different divisors, we will write the divisor at the bottom of the population column to be clear what we are dividing each number in that column by. You can also write it above that column if you prefer.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    A  162,310  7.4111  7    B  538,479  24.5872  24    C  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40    Divisor  21,900.82927       We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40.

Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for B County (the largest county in the state) increased by much more than those of A County or C County.  In this example, we got lucky and found the modified divisor on the first try. If we still had 40, we would reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we would need to raise it. We will show how to do the trial-and-error part in the next example.   "

Bates County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before King (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule.   "

We try 8,700, which gives us 70 representatives. Notice that State A, the largest state, is the one that got rounded up the second time.

If the quota is less than the geometric mean, we round down; if the quota is more than the geometric mean, we round up.     State  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34  34.49638  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23  22.49444  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6  5.477226  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4  4.472136  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2  2.44949  3    Total  610,000     70    Divisor  8714.286         These allocations add up to 70. Notice that this allocation is different than that produced by Webster's method. In this case, state E, which is smaller, got one more seat and state A got one less.   "

There are also many other situations where a group consensus is needed, and some type of voting occurs. You may be most familiar with systems where you get one vote and the candidate with the most votes wins. However, there are many other ways of determining a winner. We will look at several voting methods in this section.  For an election using any of these methods to be fair, each person must have an equal right to vote and an equal ability to exercise that right. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited any election practice that denies the right to vote based on race, but key portions of the law have been invalidated since then. Voter suppression continues today in different forms such as purging voter rolls, eliminating polling places and voter identification laws, which can also affect transgender people.   The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019 to restore elements of the Voting Rights Act and make it possible to enforce the law. It has not been taken up in the Senate, though. Follow this link if you would like to read a more detailed timeline of voting rights .    Ranked Choice Ballots  To use some of the methods we are going to study, we need to know more than just each person’s first choice. We also need to know their 2nd and 3rd choices, and so on. A ballot where each person ranks all of the choices in order of their preference is called a ranked choice ballot .   The image to the right shows an example of a ranked choice ballot \"Ranked Choice Ballot\" , Copyright 2020 Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 . Ranked choice ballots can be used in elections by mail or in person at polling places. Let’s see how to tally the results from a ranked choice election.   A ranked choice ballot with three candidates for favorite flavor of ice cream: strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. There is a grid for voters to select their first, second and third choice.      Students are voting for their class president and the candidates are Omar (O), Ana (A), and Helena (H). They have ranked the candidates according to their preference.      Vien  Ana  Marv  Tasha  Eve  Omar  Lupe  Dave  Helena  Jimmy    1st choice  A  A  O  H  A  O  H  O  H  A    2nd choice  O  H  H  A  H  H  A  H  A  H    3rd choice  H  O  A  O  O  A  O  A  O  O         Preference Schedule  To simplify this data, we create a preference schedule which combines all the people who voted with the exact same ranking. For example, Tasha, Lupe, and Helena, all voted in the same way, HAO. So, we will list that combination once, with the number 3 at the top of that column. Three students also voted for AHO, and OHA. One student voted for the ranking AOH. Below is the preference schedule.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can see the total number of votes cast: total votes.     Plurality Method  The voting method you may be most familiar with in the United States is the plurality method . In the plurality method, the candidate with the most first-choice votes is declared the winner.  There is a difference between a majority and a plurality. For a majority, a candidate must have over 50% of the votes. There are some states that require a majority in order to win an election. In more cases, though, only a plurality is required, which means having more votes than any other candidate. If a tie occurs without using ranked choice voting, then a new run-off election would be required.    In our election from above, we had this preference table:     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     For the plurality method, we only look at the 1st choice row. Totaling them up:   Ana: votes    Omar: votes    Helena: votes     Ana is the winner using the plurality voting method.  Notice that Ana won with 4 out of 10 votes, or 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.      How Many Votes are Needed to Win?  If we know how many voters there are, we can calculate the minimum number of votes needed for a majority win.  Continuing from above, there are 10 voters, so we divide that by 2 or multiply by 0.5 to find 50%. Then we round up to the next whole number to get just over 50%.   . Then we round up to 6 votes.  Exactly half of the votes would be a tie, so we round up to the next whole number. A candidate would need 6 out of 10 votes to win a majority. If there was an odd number of voters we would divide by 2 and get a decimal. Let’s say there were 13 voters:   . Then we round up to 7 votes.  Then we round up to the next whole number, which is 7 votes. A candidate can win a plurality with fewer votes than the majority, as long as they have more than any other candidate.    Insincere Voting  In a system with only two major political parties like the United States, it can be nearly impossible for third-party candidates to break through. You may feel like you would be wasting your vote if you voted for a third-party candidate. Consider this example.    Here is a two-party election with preferences shown below. It is a close race, but candidate B would win.     Number of voters  96  100    1st choice  A  B    2nd choice  B  A     Suppose a third candidate, C, entered the race, and a segment of voters sincerely want to vote for that third candidate. Here is the new preference schedule.     Number of voters  96  90  10    1st choice  A  B  C    2nd choice  B  A  B    3rd choice  C  C  A     The ten people who prefer candidate C are in a bind because if they vote for C, then A will win, but they prefer B over A. It is likely that they will vote for B, their second choice, to keep A from winning.    Situations like this can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when a person doesn’t vote according to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, a person who wants to vote for a third-party candidate realizes it would take a vote away from their major party candidate. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, they vote for the major party candidate.    Instant Runoff Method  The Instant Runoff Method is a modification of the plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.  The voting is done with ranked choice ballots and a preference schedule is generated. Then we tally all the first-choice votes. The candidate with the least first-place votes is eliminated, but any votes for that candidate are transferred to the voters’ next choice. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. We will show you how it works with an example.    Consider the preference schedule below, in which a committee is choosing a chairperson. The candidates are labeled A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity. Here is the preference schedule:     Number of voters  3  5  1  5  7  2  1    1st choice  B  C  C  B  D  A  E    2nd choice  C  A  B  D  C  E  D    3rd choice  A  E  B  C  A  B  B    4th choice  D  D  E  A  E  C  A    5th choice  E  B  A  E  B  D  C     Let’s start by tallying the first-choices.     A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.    Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.     The Instant Runoff Method is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter’s order of preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed quickly without requiring a second costly election. It also makes it safe to vote for a third-party candidate knowing that your vote will go to your second choice if your first choice can’t win.  This voting method is used in several places around the world, including the election of members of the Australian House of Representatives, statewide elections in Maine, and local elections in Benton County, Oregon (Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, 2020).    Borda Count (Point System)  Borda Count is another voting method, named for Jean-Charles de Borda, who developed the system in 1770. In this method, points are assigned to each candidate based on their ranking; 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner. We’ll show you how to do it in the next example.    A group of PCC students are getting together for a student leadership conference and they need to decide where to meet. Their members are from four campuses: Sylvania, Rock Creek, Cascade and Southeast. The votes for where to hold the conference were:     Number of voters  31  25  10  14    1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania     Now we will add a column on the left side of the table for the points. Then we multiply the points by the number of voters who put each candidate in that rank,     Points  Number of voters  31  25  10  14    4  1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    3  2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    2  3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    1  4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania     We will start with Sylvania in the bottom row and move up. They have one point times 14 voters, 2 points times 25 + 10 voters, 3 points times zero, and 4 points times 31 voters. Multiplying and then adding gives us a total of 208 points for Sylvania. You can see the calculation below and we will do the same thing for each campus:     Sylvania: points    Rock Creek: points    Cascade: points    Southwest: points     Using the Borda count method, Rock Creek is the winning location.    Note that Sylvania would have won with the plurality method. Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can be used to choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with the most first-choice support. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter’s entire ranking to determine the outcome.  Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.    Pairwise Comparison: Copeland’s Method  Another method, called pairwise comparison , the Condorcet method or Copeland’s method , attempts to be fair by looking at each pair of candidates separately.  In this method, we look at each pair as if they were the only two candidates running and determine which of the two is more preferred. In Copeland’s method, the more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded point. After all the pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.  Variations of Copeland’s Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.    Consider our class president example from the beginning of the chapter. Determine the winner using Copeland’s Method.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     We need to look at each pair of candidates to see which would win in a one-to-one comparison. First, we will systematically list all of the pairs of candidates:   Helena vs. Omar    Helena vs. Ana    Ana vs. Omar     Next, comparing Helena with Omar, we see that 6 voters, those marked in bold in the table below, would prefer Helena over Omar. Note that Helena doesn’t have to be the voter’s first choice – we’re imagining that Ana wasn’t in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     Based on this comparison of Helena vs. Omar, Helena wins 1 point.  Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland’s Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn’t choose Helena for their first choice.    Now that we’ve seen an example of each voting method, let’s run through each method for the same scenario.    Consider an advertising team voting to choose one of four different slogans, labeled A, B, C and D. Determine the winner using each method we have learned.     Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    4th choice  B  D  D  C  B        Plurality Method: We tally the first-place votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:   C wins the plurality method.   Instant Runoff Method: We start with the plurality tallies. Then we look for the slogan with the least first-choice votes, and that is B. Looking in the preference schedule at the 4 people who voted for B, we see their second choice is D. So we transfer those 4 votes to D, which now has 9.    A:  B:  C:  D:   Now A has the least number of votes with 5, so we look at the voters who chose A for their first choice. There are two columns, so three of those votes will be transferred to C and 2 will be transferred to D.    A:  B:  C:  D:   D is the winner of the instant runoff method.   Borda Count: We add a column on the left for the points, starting with 1 point for last place and counting up. Then we multiply the points by the number of votes and add them all up.     Points  Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    4  1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    3  2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    2  3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    1  4th choice  B  D  D  C  B        A: points    B: points    C: points    D: points     A is the winner of the Borda count method.   Pairwise Comparison:    First we list all the possible pairs:   A vs B    A vs C    A vs D    B vs C    B vs D    C vs D     Then we count the number of voters who would choose each candidate if they were the only two in the race.   A-10 vs B-10    A-14 vs C-6    A-11 vs D-9    B-4 vs C-16    B-13 vs D-7    C-9 vs D-11      Totaling one point for each win and half a point for each tie gives us:   A has 2.5 points    B has 1.5 points    C has 1 point    D has 1 point     A is the winner of the pairwise comparison method.      Which Method is the Most Fair?  To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:     Number of voters  5  5  5    1st choice  A  C  B    2nd choice  B  A  C    3rd choice  C  B  A     Notice that in this election: 10 people prefer A to B, 10 people prefer B to C, and 10 people prefer C to A.  No matter whom we choose as the winner, of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is called Condorcet’s Voting Paradox . In this situation, there is no fair resolution. There are many additional paradoxes and fairness criteria that are explained in David Lippman’s original version of Math in Society Math in Society: Voting Theory , by David Lippman .  Since it is not possible to have one method that is fair in every situation, it is important to decide which method is the most fair for any given situation.    Primaries and Sequential Voting  For many public offices in the U.S., a sequence of two public votes is held: a primary election and the general election. For non-partisan offices like sheriff and judge, in which political party affiliation is not declared, the primary election is usually used to narrow the field of candidates.  For partisan positions, typically, either the top two candidates receiving the most votes move forward, or the top candidate from each party will move forward. This is called sequential voting - a process in which voters cast totally new ballots after each round of eliminations. Sequential voting has become quite common in television, where it is used in reality shows like The Voice .  In some states a closed primary is used, in which only voters of each party can vote for that party’s candidates. In other states, an open primary is used, where voters can pick the party whose primary they want to vote in. In other states, caucuses are used, which are meetings of the political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open primaries have the disadvantage of raiding, though, where a voter could vote in their non-preferred party’s primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their preferred party’s candidate.  Regardless of the primary type, the general election is the main election. While rules vary state-to-state, for an independent or minor party candidate to get listed on the ballot, they typically have to gather a certain number of signatures to petition for inclusion.  In the next section we will look at a different type of election for the President of the United States.

A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.    Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.    "

Note that Helena doesn’t have to be the voter’s first choice – we’re imagining that Ana wasn’t in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.

Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland’s Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn’t choose Helena for their first choice.   "

  "body": " The Popular Vote, Electoral College and Electoral Power     Students will be able to:     Calculate the number of electors per state    Determine the winner of the popular vote    Determine the winner of the electoral college    Calculate the electoral power of each state       Choosing the U.S. President  In the last section we talked about equal voting rights and studied several voting methods. To choose the President of the United States, we use another method, called the Electoral College . The Founders, with their newfound freedom from Britain, wanted to create a democracy where citizens could participate in choosing their president. Prior to the Electoral College, there were three options proposed (Best, 2004; Clayton, 2015). They were   Congress would elect the president    State Legislatures would vote and elect the president    The people would elect a president by popular vote     The first option of having Congress do this work was declined as this would alter the balance of power among the three separate branches of government. The idea to have State Legislatures also failed as there wouldn’t be the separation between having an independent Federal Government and State Governments.  The popular vote means a candidate must win a plurality of all the votes cast for president, regardless of which state the voters live in. The popular vote was decided against as the Founders didn’t think all citizens would be informed enough about the candidates to make an educated decision (Clayton, 2015).  Instead, the Electoral College was decided upon and, in this system, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes. Each state got an equal two votes for the two senate seats. This gave smaller states a leg up as they would have at least these votes. In addition, each state would be given more votes based on their population, equal to their representation in the House (Clayton, 2015). The District of Columbia, which is not a state, also gets 3 electoral votes. A candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency. If no candidate has a majority of electoral votes then a contingent election would be held by the U.S. House of Representatives between the three candidates with the most electoral votes.  The 4 million U.S. Citizens who live in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico cannot vote in the presidential elections and do not have any electors for the U.S. President. Additionally, there are U.S. Nationals in American Samoa and other territories that cannot vote. You can learn more about residents of these territories in this Census Bureau Report .  As stated in the Constitution, the U.S. currently has 435 representatives in the House. They each serve 2-year terms, while the two senators from each state serve 6-year terms.    How many electoral votes are there in the U.S. Electoral College?       By adding all the U.S. Senators, Representatives and 3 for Washington, D.C., we have a total of 538 electoral votes.      How many electoral votes does a candidate need to win to become the President of the United States?     then round up to 270.  A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. Presidency.      The number of people who voted in the presidential election in 2016 was 136,452,150 (Ballotpedia, n.d.). How many votes would be needed to win a majority of the popular vote?     then round up to 68,226,076.  A candidate would need 68,226,076 votes to win the popular vote.      There were approximately 230,931,921 eligible voters at the time of the 2016 election (McDonald, 2016). What percentage of eligible voters voted?       About 59% of all the eligible voters voted in the 2016 election.    If you are interested in the 2016 election voting rates by race, Hispanic origin and age, you can find them in this Census Bureau Report .    How Electoral Votes are Determined  While each state has a set number of electoral votes based on the formula above, the federal government gave states the control of how they distribute and cast their electoral votes (Paiva, 2011). In 48 states, the candidate with the most votes wins all of that state’s electoral votes, often called winner-takes-all . In essence, a candidate could win with barely a majority of the popular vote in that state and the entire state’s votes goes to that individual (Clayton, 2015). In 2 states, Maine and Nebraska, however, they use a district plan where instead of winner-takes-all, they use proportionality . This means that they award electoral votes by how individual districts vote. Each district gives their electoral vote to the winner of their district and the remaining two votes go to the candidate that won statewide.  There is a movement to change from the Electoral College to the popular vote. One way this is happening is through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact . States who adopt this compact agree to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. If states and\/or D.C. with at least 270 electoral votes adopt this compact, then the winner of the popular vote would win the electoral college and the presidency. At this time there are 196 electoral votes in states and D.C. who have enacted the bill and the bill has passed one or two legislative houses in additional states with 88 electoral votes.  After citizens cast their votes by mail or on election day on the first Tuesday in November, electors gather in December and are responsible for casting the votes for their state. Electors cannot be elected officials and are chosen by their parties. Electors are expected to vote in alignment with the state they represent, but there have been faithless electors in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that states can penalize electors who do not vote according to the law of the state.  To see how the electoral college and popular votes work, we will look at a made-up country with a smaller number of states.    Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  1,362,070           Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton’s method.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  1,362,070             State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  1,362,070  21  2      Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2  5    Medium  262,340  6  2  8    Large  581,135  14  2  16    Huge  1,362,070  21  2  23    Totals  1,860,145  44  8  52     Now we can add up the total of all the electors from each state and we have:   electors.    To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 52 electors.   , round up to 27  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals         First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29     Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals             State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21      This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let’s look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win     Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52     From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let’s look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small. Let’s see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then round up to 431,036  For Small:   , then round up to 77,301       The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 508,337. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states, they could win the Electoral College with only 27.3% of the vote.  People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person’s vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the effect on small states.       People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person’s vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the effect on small states.    Electoral Power   Electoral power is the value of a person’s vote in one state compared to another state. A related topic is voting power, which is the probability of any one person influencing an election. If you are interested in voting power, you can look up the Banzhaf Power Index. To calculate the electoral power, we will calculate a ratio of electoral votes for a given number of people. We could use any number, so we will choose the number of people that each representative represents, which is our divisor of 40,000 people.    Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  1,362,070         First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  1,362,070  21  2  23      Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don’t make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let’s say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.       How is the U.S. President selected?   The president is elected through a process called The Electoral College. States send a certain number of electors, based on their populations, and whichever candidate gets the most votes from these electors becomes president.    How many electors are there in the U.S. Electoral College?   There are 538 electors in the Electoral College.    How many U.S. Senators represent each state?   Two senators represent each state.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Senator?   The term of a U.S. Senator is 6 years.    How many Representatives serve in the U.S. House of Representatives?   There are 435 Representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Representative?   The term of a U.S. Representative is 2 years.     In each fictional country in problems 7-10, use the rules of the U.S. government to complete the table and determine the following:     The total number of electors in the state.    The number of electoral votes needed for a majority and win a presidential election.       In this country there is one representative for every 50,000 residents.

Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  1,362,070           Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton’s method.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  1,362,070             State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  1,362,070  21  2      Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.

To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 52 electors.   , round up to 27  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals         First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29     Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals             State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21      This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let’s look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win     Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52     From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let’s look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small. Let’s see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then round up to 431,036  For Small:   , then round up to 77,301       The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 508,337. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states, they could win the Electoral College with only 27.3% of the vote.  People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person’s vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the effect on small states.      "

  "body": "  Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  1,362,070         First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  1,362,070  21  2  23      Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don’t make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let’s say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.   "

For example, in Indiana we currently have 9 legislative districts as shown in this map \"Indiana's congressional districts (since 2023)\" by National Atlas of the United States of America is in the Public Domain .   A map of Indiana showing the nine legislative districts.    After a reapportionment, it is up to each state government to divide their population into equal districts which each elect their representative to the U.S. House. Each representative should represent approximately the same number of people, but their areas may not be the same. Due to different population densities in urban and rural areas, you can see in the map of Oregon that the districts are not geographically equal.  Currently in most states, the state legislature draws the district boundaries. That means the party in power is in charge of drawing the new districts and they could redraw the lines to help their own party. This is called gerrymandering. Gerrymandering , pronounced, Jerrymandering, is when districts are drawn to the political advantage of those drawing the boundaries.   Gerrymandering got its name from Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts who signed a bill in 1812 that created the unusual district pictured here that looked like a salamander \"The Gerry-Mander\" by Elkanah Tisdale (1771-1835) , Originally published in the Boston Centinel, 1812 is in the Public Domain . It gave then Democrat-Republicans a bigger state Senate majority, even though the Federalist party got more votes statewide.   A map of Massachusetts in 1812 showing the unusual district shape with a salamander drawn over it.     Here are some current well-known gerrymanders. This one is called Pennsylvania’s Goofy Kicking Donald Duck \"Pennsylvania US Congressional District 7 (since 2013).tif\" by Wikimedia Commons contributors , Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. is in the Public Domain    A map of Pennsylvania with the district shaded in that looks like Goofy kicking Donald Duck.     This one is called Ohio's Lake Erie Monster \"Ohio US Congressional District 9 (since 2013).tif\" by Wikimedia Commons contributors , Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. is in the Public Domain .   A map of Ohio with the district shaded in that is long and thin along Lake Erie that looks like a sea monster.    Gerrymandering has occurred by both parties. Gerrymandering by race is illegal due to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, so people of color cannot be spread out to dilute their vote. Groups with similar interests may want to be put together to form voting blocks, but that is controversial. Gerrymandering by political party has been the subject of many lawsuits and Supreme Court cases. One of the challenges is how to measure gerrymandering to prove that it has occurred. The measurement must be easy to explain and understand in court.  Several ways to measure gerrymandering have been proposed. Some of the first methods used geometry to measure how compact a district is, rather than the sprawling salamander. But it has been shown that being compact does not equate with fairness. More recent methods use computer simulations to determine whether a certain map is an extreme outlier compared to other possible maps, or measure something called partisan bias .  In this book we will focus on the efficiency gap, proposed in 2015 by Nicholas Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee. The efficiency gap is a measure of the advantage one party has over the other party due to the partisanship of the voters in each district.  Later in this section we will learn how to calculate and interpret the efficiency gap. First, let’s look at how we can tell whether a map is fair or not.    Proportionality and Fairness  For a map to be fair, we would expect the portion of seats that a political party wins in an election to be about the same as the portion of that party in the state. This is called proportionality . For example, if a state is 50:50 Democrat to Republican, they should each get about half of the seats. There is nothing in the constitution that guarantees proportionality, but this is a basic measure of fairness. Let's look at a couple of examples using fractions and decimals.   If a state with 6 seats is Republican and Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?  We will multiply the total number of seats by fraction that each party represents.  Republicans: seats.  Democrats: seats.  In this case the Republicans should have 2 seats and the Democrats should have 4 seats. The numbers won't usually work out so nicely so let's look at another example.     If a state with 8 seats is Republican and Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?    We will multiply the total number of seats by the decimal portion that each party represents.  Republicans: seats.  Democrats: seats.  By rounding, the most fair combination would be Democrats with 4 seats and Republicans with 4 seats. This is not completely proportional, though, because we can't assign fractions of seats.    Now that we can tell whether a map is fair, let's see how gerrymandering works.    How to Gerrymander  There are two main ways to gerrymander a map, by packing and cracking. Packing is when all the people of one political party are packed into a district. Since a party only needs a plurality or majority to win, all those extra votes would be surplus. Cracking dilutes a party’s votes by spreading out the voters so they can’t win as many districts.   Here is a small sample map to see how this works. In this fictitious state, we have 35 people and 5 districts. So we will need 7 people in each district. You can see how they are spread out in the map, with Republicans denoted by R’s and Democrats marked with D’s. To keep it simple, we are only looking at two parties and they will need a majority to win an election. We are also assuming that all voters will vote and that they vote according to their party which may not always be the case.   A simplified state map   A rectangular map with D's and R's spread out to indicate Democrats and Republicans. There are more Democrats concentrated toward the center like a city with more Republicans spread out toward the edges like rural areas.     Before we draw a fair map, let’s try gerrymandering it for Democrats and then for the Republicans.      We will first try to advantage the Democrats. There are 7 people in each district, so a party needs 4 votes to win the election. We will draw the lines to put 4 Democrats in each district along with 3 Republicans to spread them out by cracking. Here is our map.  We were able to get 4 Democrats and 3 Republicans in districts 1, 2, 3 and 5. The Republicans will win in district 4 because it will be 5-2, but if the 5th Republican had been in another district, the map would have been more fair. As it is drawn, the population is 17:18 but the seats are 1:4, which does not seem fair.    The map gerrymandered in favor of Democrats   The previous map with district lines drawn. Districts 1, 2, 3 and 5 have 4 Democrats and 3 Republians each. District 4 has 2 Democrats and 5 Rupublicans.         The Efficiency Gap  To try to measure how unfair the map is, let’s learn how to calculate the efficiency gap. First, we will tally the votes in the table below, and note how the election results would turn out by using bold numbers for the party with more voters in each district. For example, there are 4 D’s and 3 R’s in district 1, so the Democrats would theoretically win that district.     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  4  3      2  4  3      3  4  3      4  2  5      5  4  3      Total  18  17       Election Results:   Democrats win 4 seats    Republicans win 1 seat     Next, we will calculate how many votes would be extra over the amount needed to win the election. These are the surplus votes . In this example, with 7 voters, the majority of a district is 4 votes, so we will subtract 4 from each winning side. From each losing side, all of the votes are considered surplus because they did not go toward electing a candidate of their party. Then we add all the surplus votes for each party.     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  4  3   3    2  4  3   3    3  4  3   3    4  2  5  2     5  4  3   3    Total  18  17  2  13     The difference between the surplus votes as a percentage of the population is the efficiency gap. As a formula it is written:     To get a positive result, we put the larger number first and we have   or 31.4%.  The efficiency gap is 31.4%. To understand what this percentage means, we compare it with the percentage that each district represents in the state. Since our state has 5 districts, each one is 20% of the population. Here’s how we got that by dividing or as a fraction of the state.   districts , or, or   In this case, the efficiency gap is worth more than one full seat, which suggests that the Democratic party has at least one extra seat than they would with proportional representation.     For another example, we will take the same map and gerrymander it for the Republicans. This time we will pack as many Democrats as we can into the middle, and then use cracking to form the rest of the districts, trying to get 4 R’s in as many as we can. Here is the map.   The map gerrymandered in favor of Republicans   The previous map with new district lines drawn. This time Districts 1, 3, 4 and 5 have 4 Republicans and 3 Democrats each. District 2 has 7 Democrats packed in and District 4 has 2 Democrats and 5 Rupublicans.     Now, let's fill in our table:     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  3  4  3     2  7  0   0    3  3  4  3     4  2  5  2     5  3  4  3     Total  18  17  14  1     Election Results:   Democrats win 1 seat    Republicans win 4 seats     To calculate our efficiency gap,   or 37.1%.  This shows the opposite unfairness where the population is 17:18 but the seats are 4:1. We can calculate the number of seats that the efficiency gap is worth by dividing 37.1% by 20%.     The efficiency gap is worth approximately 1.9 seats.  Stephanopoulos and McGhee gave a guideline of around 8% or less for the efficiency gap and this one is 37.1%. The Republicans have at least one extra seat than they would if the seats were proportional to the population.        Now we will try to create a fair map and see what the efficiency gap is. There is an odd number of districts and the population is 17:18 so it might be challenging to make it fair.  With this map, we tried to have two districts that favored Democrats, two that favored Republicans, and one that might go either way. Since there is one extra Democrat, the population is 17:18 and the seats are 2:3    A more fair map   The previous map with new district lines drawn. Districts 2, 3 and 5 have 4 Democrats and 3 Republians each. Districts 1 and 4 have 3 Democrats and 4 Rupublicans each.     Let’s see how the efficiency gap comes out in this situation:     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  3  4  3     2  4  3   3    3  4  3   3    4  3  4  3     5  4  3   3    Total  18  17  6  9     Election Results:   Democrats win 3 seats    Republicans win 2 seats     The efficiency gap is   or 8.57%.  This gap is much smaller than in our gerrymandered examples and near the 8% guideline. Due to the odd number of seats and even distribution of the parties, this is as small as we can get the efficiency gap in this situation. It is much less than 20%, which is one seat.     The efficiency gap is worth less than half a seat or about 0.43 seats.    There are still many court cases in progress alleging gerrymandered maps so it seems like a new solution is needed. Some alternatives are appointing independent commissions to draw the lines, or changing the system altogether with proportional representation . The statisticians at FiveThirtyEight used a web application to draw new lines in all of the states according to six different measures. You can read about it in this article .    Exercises   When does redistricting of state districts happen?   Redistricting happens every 10 years after the census is completed. A state might not change its districts unless the number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives has changed.    Who determines where the district lines are drawn?   Each state government is in charge of drawing the lines.    What are the two rules for drawing district lines?   The rules are districts must be contiguous and you can’t gerrymander by race.    What are the two ways to gerrymander?   The two ways to gerrymander are by packing, putting all of one party in a district, or by cracking, splitting up a party into many districts, so their votes are ineffective.    If a state with 7 seats is 62% Republican and 38% Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 4 Republican seats and 3 Democratic seats.    If a state with 12 seats is 43% Republican and 57% Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 5 Republican seats and 7 Democratic seats.    If a state with 3 seats is 4\/5 Republican and 1\/5 Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 2 Republican seats and 1 Democratic seat.    If a state with 9 seats is 3\/8 Republican and 5\/8 Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 3 Republican seats and 6 Democratic seats.    If a state with 11 seats is 52% Republican, 40% Democrat and 8% Green Party, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 6 Republican seats, 4 Democratic seats and 1 Green Party seat.    If a state with 18 seats is 31% Republican, 58% Democrat and 11% Progressive Party, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 6 Republican seats, 10 Democratic seats and 2 Progressive Party seats.     For each map in problems 11-20, complete the following:     How many votes are needed for a majority?    How many seats are won by each party?    Calculate the efficiency gap.    Calculate the percentage of the state that each district represents.    Calculate how many district seats the efficiency gap is worth.    Explain whether you think the map is fair and why or why not.       This state has 4 districts with 7 people in each district.

This shows the opposite unfairness where the population is 17:18 but the seats are 4:1. We can calculate the number of seats that the efficiency gap is worth by dividing 37.1% by 20%.     The efficiency gap is worth approximately 1.9 seats.  Stephanopoulos and McGhee gave a guideline of around 8% or less for the efficiency gap and this one is 37.1%. The Republicans have at least one extra seat than they would if the seats were proportional to the population.   "

This gap is much smaller than in our gerrymandered examples and near the 8% guideline. Due to the odd number of seats and even distribution of the parties, this is as small as we can get the efficiency gap in this situation. It is much less than 20%, which is one seat.     The efficiency gap is worth less than half a seat or about 0.43 seats.   "
